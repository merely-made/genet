//! Phase 3: run a `testharness.js` test and collect its per-subtest results.
//!
//! Extracts the test's own scripts (inline `<script>` + local `<script src>`,
//! skipping `testharness.js` / the report hook, which the host surface supplies),
//! then runs them against `testharness.js` on a fresh [`Runtime`] and reads the
//! results through the bridge ([`Runtime::run_testharness`]).
//!
//! Engine: selectable via `--engine boa|nova` (see [`Engine`]). Boa is the
//! pure-Rust conformance oracle; Nova is the native primary. The harness's
//! regex-incompatible source is shimmed host-side (`harness_regex_compat`), and
//! the WTF-8/UTF-16 string-indexing bugs that once panicked Nova are fixed in the
//! fork (`docs/2026-06-02_nova_wtf8_indexing_fixes.md`); both engines now produce
//! real numbers on the same corpus.
//!
//! Limitation: the test starts with an empty DOM. Tests that build their own DOM
//! (`createElement`) or are pure-JS run; tests that query elements declared in the
//! HTML body do not see them yet (parsing the body into the scripted DOM is a
//! later step).
