//! Genet's retained document sessions: Livery HTML and scripted HTML as
//! session engines (2026-07-10 session-engines plan). The reader and smolweb
//! lanes and the remote fetch integration are `mere-document-lanes` since the
//! platform boundary plan's P1 split this crate by authority.
//!
//! These types began as pelt's convenience lanes; the formalization promotes
//! them to an engine-grade component. Each lane is a retained layout session
//! producing [`netrender::Scene`] frames on demand, with scroll, activation,
//! and (scripted) a tick + quiescence seam. [`engines`] wraps each lane in
//! `inker::SessionEngine<Scene>` so hosts spawn them through the
//! `SessionRegistry` instead of hand-matching engine ids; pelt consumes this
//! component like any other host.

/// HTML's browsing-context tree: parent, children, top, each context's active
/// document and its own session history (the iframes plan, phase one).

/// Cross-context policy: same-origin access, sandbox gates, the cross-origin
/// WindowProxy member list, and the two isolation headers with their named
/// single-process residuals.

// and hosts' chrome (moved with the lanes from pelt).
