//! HTML's parsing model with scripts interleaved: the drive loop that owns
//! *when* a script runs, over the tree sink that owns *what* the tree looks
//! like.
//!
//! The regression this exists against is structural. Genet used to parse a
//! whole document, copy the finished tree into the arena, and only then run its
//! scripts in document order. Everything that observes the tree *as it is being
//! built* is wrong under that model, and each case fails differently: a custom
//! element defined by an early script is not yet in the registry when a later
//! tag is parsed; a declarative `<template shadowrootmode>` cannot consult a
//! registry that is still empty; a `MutationObserver` registered by an early
//! script sees one bulk tree instead of the parser's inserts; and
//! `document.write` has no token stream to write into.
//!
//! The loop is small because html5ever hands over at exactly the right point:
//!
//! ```text
//! open the document's source stream, push source
//! loop {
//!     resume()                       -> Done | Created | Script(node)
//!     Created:
//!         upgrade the elements just created  (a definition exists)
//!     Script(node):
//!         upgrade parser-created custom elements
//!         classify the element       (classic / module, inline / external, async / defer)
//!         run it, with currentScript set
//!         microtask checkpoint       (this is where a MutationObserver fires)
//!         refresh the policy table   (registry facts the tree builder asks for)
//! }
//! end()
//! readyState = interactive; readystatechange
//! deferred scripts, in document order
//! DOMContentLoaded
//! readyState = complete; readystatechange; window load
//! ```
//!
//! `document.write` is not in that loop, because HTML has the parser process
//! written characters *during* the `write()` call. The tokenizer therefore
//! lives in [`crate::dom::markup_insertion`]'s host state rather than here, so
//! the native can feed it; when the written source reaches a `<script>` the
//! native stalls the pause and this loop takes it, because script *timing* —
//! `async`, `defer`, modules, external sources — belongs here.
//!
//! The arena is *moved* between the host state and the stream's cell around
//! each tokenizer call, rather than shared behind a second `RefCell`. A
//! tree-sink call and a native call both want `&mut ScriptedDom`, and they are
//! never live at the same instant — the tokenizer has returned before any
//! script runs — so moving is both sufficient and cheap (`ScriptedDom` is a
//! handful of maps behind one pointer each). Sharing it instead would put a
//! re-entrant borrow one careless native away from a panic.
