//! Session-engine traits and registry — the third engine kind
//! (2026-07-10 session-engines plan).
//!
//! Document engines (`Engine`) are request/response: bytes in,
//! serializable `EngineDocument` blocks out — the stored/authored
//! lane. Surface engines (`SurfaceEngine`) stream GPU textures from
//! external producers. Session engines sit between: **retained document
//! sessions** that lay content out once and then produce paint frames on
//! demand, with scroll, activation, and (for scripted lanes) a tick +
//! quiescence seam. The genet HTML lanes and the smolweb native lane are
//! session engines.
//!
//! The frame type is generic (`F`) so this crate keeps zero paint
//! dependencies: a netrender host instantiates `F = netrender::Scene`; a
//! different host picks its own frame type. Lane-specific construction seams
//! (resource fetchers, cookie jars, themes) are injected into the concrete
//! `SessionEngine` at registration time, not carried in the spawn request —
//! the request stays plain data.
