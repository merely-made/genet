//! Shared automatability substrate for the genet apps.
//!
//! Every genet app is cambium-based, so every one emits the same thing: a
//! semantic, ARIA-attributed [`ScriptedDom`] laid out by Livery and Buckram. That is
//! the substrate a script, test, or model drives an app through — "click the
//! element labelled X" instead of poking a pixel. This crate is the generic
//! part of that: resolving a **selector** (a role or class, plus optional text)
//! to a **window-space point**, across an app's retained surfaces, using only
//! the owned engine's hit geometry. The app-specific part — which surfaces it has,
//! its typed observation, how it routes a delivered point — stays in the app,
//! behind a small trait (added as consumers pull it; this first slice is the
//! resolver every one of those verbs stands on).
//!
//! A [`ProbeSurface`] is one retained runner's DOM plus where it sits in the
//! window and the sheet it lays out under. An app with several runners (turnstone:
//! chrome, roster grid, gloss, trail) lists one each; [`resolve`] searches them
//! in order and returns the first match's centre. Because the resolution is one
//! function over all surfaces, an app stops needing a bespoke geometry lookup
//! per widget — the point the extraction *simplifies* the consumer, not just
//! shares code.
//!
//! [`ScriptedDom`]: genet_scripted_dom::ScriptedDom
