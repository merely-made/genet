//! **Ortet — the raw Genet host.**
//!
//! A genet is a whole clonal colony; an ortet is the original individual it
//! descends from. This is the reference individual of the engine: the one
//! headed port that proves Genet runs with no Mere crate anywhere in its
//! dependency cone. `support/ci/check_dependency_cones.py` witnesses that on
//! every CI run.
//!
//! It is a window, a document, and nothing else. No tabs, no tiles, no reader
//! lane, no smolweb, no profiles, no settings, no persistence. All of those are
//! product decisions, and product decisions live in Mere.
//!
//! A handful of small pieces:
//!
//! - [`args`] — the command line, and the address normalization the fetch lanes
//!   and `resolve_href` both rely on.
//! - [`fetch`] — the scheme split: local schemes to `genet-documents`'
//!   `LocalFetcher`, http(s) to netfetcher, everything else an honest miss.
//! - [`shell`] — the winit window, the per-frame shape, and navigation.
//! - [`receipt`] — one composed frame read back to a PNG with its digest.
//! - [`mutate`] — the host-driven per-frame DOM mutation pattern (`--mutate`).
//! - [`timing`] — per-frame phase attribution, work kept apart from wait.
//!
//! The library half exists so the argument parser and the scheme split can be
//! unit-tested without a GPU; `main.rs` is a thin wrapper over [`shell::run`].
