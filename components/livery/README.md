# Livery

Livery is Genet's generated CSS property and cascade engine. Its property
catalog and original core began under MIT or Apache-2.0; the crate is now
licensed under MPL-2.0 as it incorporates provenance-marked Stylo harvests.

The first lane was Cambium structural UI. Fullweb documents run on Livery too
since the Stylo route was deleted on 2026-08-21. Selector parsing and matching
come from the `cadency` crate.

The 87-property native lane catalog generates concrete property metadata and a
typed `ComputedValues`. The current ratchet adds box geometry (`right`,
`bottom`, min/max sizing, `box-sizing`, and `aspect-ratio`), corner radii,
visibility and pointer-event state, text alignment and spacing, box shadows,
two-stop linear-gradient and raster `data:` backgrounds, bounded opacity,
background-color, text color, and border-top-color/border-bottom-color transition metadata
(including simultaneous `all` sampling and explicit two- and three-property
lists),
a bounded `@keyframes` opacity animation with linear and named easing
functions, intrinsic image tiling with bounded position/repeat modes, flexbox,
and a bounded grid track/placement family.
The seed value layer
covers the audited Cambium and UA
stylesheet values, including lengths, percentages, linear `calc()`, colors,
and the lane's keyword families. The bounded E2 resolver adds declaration and
shorthand parsing, selector matching, cascade ordering and inheritance, and
media evaluation on a Genet-shaped `Device`. Cambium lane integration lives in
the separate `genet-livery` crate: a `LayoutDom` adapter, concrete style plane,
and standalone Taffy box path with neutral paint emission.
