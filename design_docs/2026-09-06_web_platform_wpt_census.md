# Web platform WPT census: the non-CSS directories

**Date:** 2026-09-06

**Status:** complete. Measurement only; no renderer or runtime source changed.

**Historical baseline notice — 2026-09-26:** this is the September 6 Boa
disk-mode snapshot, not current implementation status or a Vano census.
Selection/Range, MutationObserver, Dedicated Worker and substantial Shadow DOM
support landed afterward. See the
[dated ledger reconciliation](2026-09-07_standards_to_features_ledger.md#implementation-reconciliation--2026-09-26)
for their scoped receipts and open gates. Vano is the current backend behind the
retained `--engine nova` name. No census was rerun for this documentation update.

**Parent:** the CSS ledgers under
[`docs/2026-08-24_wpt_harness_ledger_execution_plan.md`](../docs/2026-08-24_wpt_harness_ledger_execution_plan.md)
and [`docs/2026-07-28_absolute_css_conformance_ledger.md`](../docs/2026-07-28_absolute_css_conformance_ledger.md),
whose method this census extends to the rest of the web platform.

## Vano rerun, 2026-09-29

A full-scope rerun is in progress against Genet `19c206873ab` plus the isolated
worker reporting repair published in `0c4aa9f60b8`, and
Vano `8ad0841255c2cbb679f7c704417d427b3cb3e961`, using the retained CLI
`--engine nova`. The [dated receipt](receipts/2026-09-29_vano_wpt_census/receipt.md)
records source isolation, exact commands, harness differences and evidence.
The archived maps contain **82**, not 86, result files, covering
21,672 unique file/variant records. The manifest SHA-256 is unchanged, but the
current runner additionally discovers dedicated-worker variants. The rerun
separates exact historical membership from newly discovered records. Historical
Boa rows below remain unchanged; the new measurement is not yet complete.

## Purpose

Until this run, `genet-wpt` had exact result maps only for the CSS manifest
and five small non-CSS probes (`dom`, `dom/nodes`, `dom/abort`,
`fetch/api/basic`, `html/webappapis/timers`). The question this census answers
is the one the CSS ledger answers for layout: on the checked-in WPT tree,
which web-platform directories does the scripted tier host, and at what
absolute pass count. It is an inventory for assigning owners, not a
conformance claim. No percentage is reported.

## Scope and provenance

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| genet commit | `2c47cff7627`, clean tree |
| WPT tree | `tests/wpt/tests` as vendored at that commit |
| `MANIFEST.json` SHA-256 prefix | `d5ec5be9bf1a75ed` |
| Runner | `genet-wpt` release, `--features netfetch`, SHA-256 `a362fa85878ec3c211a1301a205b9777d3e70cd6f026bb76614e15449dbd3477` |
| Lane | `testharness`, engine Boa, renderer Livery, disk mode |
| Directories | 41 top-level WPT directories, `html` split by subdirectory (82 result files; archived-map count verified 2026-09-29) |
| Raw results | `Code/testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-09-06_platform_census/` (outside Git, per the ledger README) |

Directories chosen: every top-level WPT directory a web engine owns that is not
`css`: `dom`, `html`, `fetch`, `websockets`, `xhr`, `workers`,
`service-workers`, `storage`, `IndexedDB`, `custom-elements`, `shadow-dom`,
`url`, `encoding`, `streams`, `FileAPI`, `webmessaging`, `eventsource`,
`uievents`, `pointerevents`, `selection`, `editing`, `svg`, `mathml`,
`webaudio`, `WebCryptoAPI`, `console`, `hr-time`, `performance-timeline`,
`resource-timing`, `navigation-timing`, `user-timing`,
`intersection-observer`, `resize-observer`, `web-animations`,
`scroll-animations`, `cookies`, `referrer-policy`, `content-security-policy`,
`cors`, `mixed-content`, `upgrade-insecure-requests`. Not run: device and
sensor APIs, payments, WebRTC, WebXR, WebGPU (its CTS is not in WPT),
`infrastructure`, and every reftest lane. `html/semantics/the-root-element`
does not exist in this tree.

## Method

One `genet-wpt testharness <dir> --write-expectations` invocation per
directory, sequential, from a script kept beside the raw results
(`run_disk.sh`). `aggregate.py` joins the result files and classifies the
`ERROR` lines from each run log; `summary.md` is its output and the table
below is copied from it.

**Disk mode, not server mode.** A server-mode probe of `dom/events`
(`--spawn-server`, 179 tests) took 29m57s against 28s in disk mode and
moved four subtests. The server-mode drive loop is wall-clock, so every test
that awaits an event that never settles costs the full 15-second deadline;
the disk-mode loop uses virtual clocks and quiesces immediately. At that
rate the 21,672-file set is days, not hours. The probe pair is kept as
`dom_events_probe.json` and `dom_events_disk_probe.json`. Consequence: the
network-dependent families (`fetch` beyond `fetch/api`, `websockets`, `xhr`,
`cors`, `cookies`, `referrer-policy`, `content-security-policy`,
`mixed-content`, `upgrade-insecure-requests`, `resource-timing`,
`eventsource`, `service-workers`) are measured without a server and their
counts are floors. A server-mode census of those families needs a runner
whose deadline is shorter or whose drive loop is interruptible.

**One hang.** `html/webappapis/scripting/processing-model-2/integration-with-the-javascript-agent-formalism/atomics-wait-async.https.any.html`
never returns under Boa and is not caught by the harness deadline. The
whole-directory run of `html/webappapis` was killed after 1,005s; the
directory was rerun file by file under an external 90-second timeout
(`run_perfile.sh`, merged by `merge.py`) and that one test is recorded as
`error` with reason `hang-killed-90s`. A watchdog (`watchdog.sh`) armed for
the rest of the run recorded no further stall.

## Results

Files are manifest test files including query variants. `Pass` is a file
whose every subtest passed; `Fail` is a file with at least one failing
subtest; `Error` is a harness or script error before results; `No results`
is a file that ran and reported nothing; `Skip` is a non-testharness or
non-window file the lane cannot host.

| **Total** | 21672 | 676 | 13845 | 2392 | 985 | 3774 | 61448 / 1579098 |

The `Total` row spans 82 result files. `html` on its own is 8,938 files.
Subtest totals are dominated by `encoding` (1.33 million, mostly the legacy
multibyte slices) and `editing` (97,687); treat file counts as the comparable
column.

### Skip reasons

| Count | Reason |
|---:|---|
| 3,670 | non-testharness (reftest, manual, visual, crash, or no harness include) |
| 86 | XHTML documents |
| 18 | worker-only or non-window global |

### Error classes

The 2,392 errored files fall into a few classes, from the run logs:

| Count | Class | Reading |
|---:|---|---|
| 723 | `<global> is not defined` | a missing interface or helper; itemised below |
| 611 | cannot convert `null` or `undefined` to object | a lookup that returned null, typically a missing element, property, or `document.body`-style accessor |
| 360 | not a callable function | a missing method on an existing interface |
| 293 | opaque `JsError` | uncategorised engine error |
| about 260 | Boa syntax errors in `import.meta` or object property names | see the harness caveats |

### Missing globals

Counts are files whose first error was a `ReferenceError` on that name.
Helper names from WPT support scripts are marked; they point at a harness
loading gap, not an engine gap.

| Count | Name | Kind |
|---:|---|---|
| 100 | `createSVGElement` | WPT helper from `/resources/SVGAnimationTestCase-testharness.js` (harness) |
| 86 | `crypto` | engine: Web Crypto |
| 83 | `XMLHttpRequest` | engine |
| 63 | `smil_async_test` | WPT helper, same SVG support script (harness) |
| 51 | `Worker` | engine |
| 37 / 36 / 36 | `test_valid_value`, `test_computed_value`, `test_invalid_value` | WPT helpers from `/css/support/*.js` (harness) |
| 22 | `performance` | engine: High Resolution Time |
| 20 | `getSelection` | engine: Selection API |
| 19 | `test_namespace` | WPT helper (harness) |
| 18 | `AudioContext` | engine: Web Audio |
| 14 | `BroadcastChannel` | engine |
| 12 | `IDBKeyRange` | engine: IndexedDB |
| 12 | `SharedWorker` | engine |
| 9 | `MutationObserver` | engine |
| 8 | `MessageChannel` | engine |
| 8 | `WebSocket` | engine |
| 6 | `DOMMatrix` | engine: Geometry Interfaces |
| 6 | `Option` | engine: named constructor |
| 5 each | `IntersectionObserver`, `ResizeObserver`, `ViewTimeline` | engine |
| 4 | `PerformanceObserver` | engine |
| 3 each | `trustedTypes`, `HTMLMenuItemElement`, `queueMicrotask`, `OfflineAudioContext`, `registerProcessor` | engine |
| 2 each | `alert`, `Image`, `OffscreenCanvas`, `scheduler` | engine |
| 1 each | `CSSStyleDeclaration`, `HTMLFrameSetElement` | engine |

These are first errors only. A file that dies on `crypto` may also need
`Worker`; the true demand for each interface is at least this count.

## Harness caveats found by the run

These are runner gaps that depress counts and should be fixed before the
next census, so that the delta measures the engine.

> **Caveats 1-3 closed 2026-09-07** by
> [`2026-09-07_wpt_harness_repair_plan.md`](2026-09-07_wpt_harness_repair_plan.md),
> whose re-run of this census moves 204 files and leaves the rest of these maps
> byte-identical. Caveat 1's `/css/support/` guess did not hold: those helpers
> have a different cause and did not move. Caveat 4 is still open.

1. **Absolute `/resources/*` support scripts are dropped.** The disk loader
   filters harness includes by path and takes
   `/resources/SVGAnimationTestCase-testharness.js` with them, which is why
   `svg/animations` reports 163 helper `ReferenceError`s. The `/css/support/`
   helpers (`test_valid_value` and kin, 128 files) likely share the cause; not
   traced to the line.
2. **Server-side handlers are read as JavaScript in disk mode.** A
   `<script src="log.py?...">` include resolves to the Python file on disk and
   Boa reports a syntax error in `import.meta`. Server mode is the fix; see the
   timing problem above.
3. **The harness deadline does not interrupt a blocked engine call.**
   `Atomics.waitAsync` hung the process. The external timeout used here is a
   workaround; a per-test worker, as `test262` already has, is the fix.
4. **Reftests in these directories are unmeasured.** `html`, `svg`, `mathml`
   and `editing` carry most of the 3,670 non-testharness skips; a reftest
   lane over them is a separate GPU run.

## Reading the inventory

Grouped by what the number says about the engine, largest first:

- **Hosted and partly passing:** `dom` (150 all-pass, 2,318 subtests),
  `html/dom` (40,766 subtests, the reflection tables), `custom-elements`
  (2,041), `html/syntax` (2,425), `fetch` (1,097, the network-free `fetch/api`
  surface), `html/semantics/scripting-1` (768), `webaudio` (667, from
  interface-shape tests), `url` (351), `streams` (298), `FileAPI` (276).
- **Hosted, almost nothing passing, interface absent or inert:**
  `websockets` (0 of 1,392 subtests), `service-workers` (0 of 1,526),
  `IndexedDB` (5 of 880), `storage` (0), `eventsource` (0), `xhr` (53 of
  1,013), `workers` (17 of 574), `selection` (0 of 280), `editing` (1 of
  97,687), `shadow-dom` (18 of 8,654), `html/canvas` (33 of 4,142),
  `intersection-observer` (0), `resize-observer` (0), `performance-timeline`
  (0), `resource-timing` (0), `navigation-timing` (0), `hr-time` (0),
  `html/interaction` (6 of 511), `html/semantics/popovers` (1 of 3,783).
- **Security and policy families, unmeasurable without a server:**
  `referrer-policy` (2 of 8,443), `content-security-policy` (102 of 3,423),
  `mixed-content` (2), `upgrade-insecure-requests` (0), `cors` (2 of 42),
  `cookies` (3 of 958), and the COOP, COEP and document-isolation
  subtrees of `html`. Their disk-mode counts say nothing about netfetcher,
  which the fetch plan already proved against a live server.
- **Mostly skipped, reftest-shaped:** `svg` (1,022 of 1,640 skipped),
  `mathml` (401 of 579), `html/rendering` (316 of 462), `html/editing` (221 of
  424), `html/semantics/forms` (211 of 648).

Each of the second and third groups is a candidate lane in the sense of the
Buckram and Livery lane program: a named directory, an exact baseline map,
and a reconciliation that assigns every residual. This document is the
baseline those lanes diff against.

## Reftest lane over html, svg, mathml and editing (2026-09-07)

**Status:** complete. Measurement only; no renderer or runtime source changed.

The four non-testharness families this census could only mark `Skip`
(`html`, `svg`, `mathml`, `editing`) run under `genet-wpt reftest`, not
`testharness`, and need a GPU. This lane measures them with the same
directory list the census used for `html` (split by subdirectory), plus
`svg`, `mathml` and `editing` whole. Raw results are under
`Code/testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-09-07_reftest_platform/`, per the ledger
README.

One `genet-wpt reftest <dir> --engine boa --renderer livery --tests-root
C:/t/genet-5af76a0/tests/wpt/tests --write-expectations <file>` invocation
per directory, sequential (reftests are GPU-bound, one process at a time), a
150-second stall watchdog (`watchdog.sh`) armed for the whole run and a
per-directory fallback (`run_perfile.sh`, `merge.py`) that reruns a killed
directory file by file under a 90-second external timeout, merging the
per-file records back into that directory's expectation JSON. Before the
full run, `html/obsolete` (26 files) was run alone as a GPU-boot smoke test
and produced a real pixel comparison (1 pass, 1 local-bucket fail), then its
output was discarded and the directory rerun as part of the sequential pass
below.

A `pass` with no reason is an ordinary pixel pass. The runner labels a pass
`reference-unverified` only for tests in the checked inventory
(`ports/genet-wpt/expectations/reftest/reference_verification.json`), which
covers the CSS fragmentation scopes and twenty CSS guards and nothing under
these directories, so the `Ref-unverified` column below is zero by
construction and the `Verified` column means "not in that inventory", not
"reference independently verified". A reference-verification pass over these
families is open work before their passes earn conformance credit.

### Result

All 42 directories ran to completion in the first sequential pass — the
watchdog recorded no stall (`stalls.log` is empty after the run) and no
directory needed the per-file fallback. Wall time for the full sequential
pass was under six minutes (`run_reftest.log` timestamps), against an hour
external timeout per directory.

Fail-shape buckets, summed across directories (`aggregate.py` parses these
from each log's `fail buckets:` line, not from the JSON, since the bucket is
per-failure diagnostic rather than a stored field):

| Count | Bucket | Reading |
|---:|---|---|
| 10 | `whole` | >=50% of pixels differ (layout or UA-chrome shape wrong) |
| 341 | `local` | localized large delta (a feature or paint area is wrong, rest matches) |
| 75 | `mismatch-eq` | pixels are identical yet the test still failed (an `==` reftest reporting fail, or a `!=` reftest reporting fail on a match) |

`dims` (size mismatch) and `aa` (small per-channel, anti-alias/tolerance)
were not observed. All 426 `Fail` records are accounted for by these three
buckets (10 + 341 + 75 = 426). Note: the aggregate script's original bucket
regex did not admit the hyphen in `mismatch-eq` and silently split it into a
spurious `eq` bucket; `aggregate.py` in this lane's directory was corrected
in place (`(\w+\??)=` to `([\w-]+\??)=`) before the totals above were taken.

### Hangs and handling

None. The 2026-09-06 census's one hang
(`atomics-wait-async.https.any.html`, testharness lane) does not recur here:
that file is a `dom`/`webappapis` testharness case, not one of this lane's
reftest files. No directory in this run exceeded the 150-second watchdog
threshold or the one-hour per-directory external timeout; `run_perfile.sh`
and its per-file fallback were prepared but never invoked.

### Near versus far reading

**Near (file-count) reading:** the pass column looks small against Skip —
602 of 11,951 files (about 5%) produced a pixel pass, 426
failed, and 10,923 were skipped as non-reftest members of these directories
(manual, crash, or otherwise unhosted files the WPT manifest still lists
under these paths). Several directories (`editing`, `html_webappapis`,
`html_interaction`, the policy families) pass zero files outright — either
because everything in them is a manual/visual test the reftest lane cannot
host, or the feature they gate (COOP/COEP/document-isolation, popovers,
permission-element beyond its 36) is not yet functional under Livery.

**Far (what's hosted) reading:** of the 1,028 files this lane actually
executed as reftests (602 pass + 426 fail; 10,923 of the 11,951 total were
non-reftest skips the manifest still lists here), Livery reference-verified
59% (602/1,028). That is a materially higher hit rate than the testharness
census's non-CSS families, and the fail buckets are concentrated in `local`
(341, a localized rendering delta rather than a structural failure) rather
than `whole` (10, structurally wrong) — consistent with a renderer that
lays most of these documents out correctly and differs on paint detail
inside them. `mismatch-eq` (75) is the one bucket worth flagging for tool
correctness ahead of a reconciliation pass: it means the pixels already
match (or don't, for a `!=` test) but the test still reports fail, which
points at either fuzzy-match/reference-selection logic or a metadata
mismatch rather than rendering fidelity, and is a candidate false-negative
pool a reconciliation should re-check before spending effort on genuine
paint bugs.

Raw per-directory JSON exact maps and logs: `Code/testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-09-07_reftest_platform/reftest/`.
`summary.md` in that directory is `aggregate.py`'s output and is the source
of the table above.

### The mismatch-eq bucket

**Status:** complete. Verdict only; no runner source changed.

Reconciled the 75 `mismatch-eq` fail records flagged above as a candidate
false-negative pool. The question per file: is it a `!=` (mismatch) reftest
whose candidate and reference render identically — a genuine engine failure
(the feature under test did nothing, so both pages painted the same wrong
picture) — or an `==` reftest failing with identical pixels, which would be a
runner defect (a match should never fail on zero pixel delta)?

**Bucket construction rules out the second case by code shape.** In
`ports/genet-wpt/src/reftest.rs::reftest`, `mismatch-eq` is only ever
incremented in the `MatchKind::Mismatch` arm of the fail branch (the
`MatchKind::Match` arm buckets through `diff_label`, which has its own
`equal?` label for a `==` test that fails on zero diff). An `==` test failing
with identical pixels cannot land in `mismatch-eq`; it would show up as
`equal?`.

**Grouping.** All 75 records are `FAIL  mismatch` lines (verified against the
raw logs, not inferred from the code alone: `grep -rn "FAIL  mismatch"
*.log` across `Code/testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-09-07_reftest_platform/reftest/`
returns exactly 75 lines, matching the bucket total file-for-file). By
relation: **75 of 75 are `!=`, 0 are `==`.** The `equal?` label (the bucket an
`==` runner defect would use) does not appear anywhere in the 42 directories'
logs. By directory:

| Directory | mismatch-eq count |
|---|---:|
| mathml | 33 |
| html_semantics_permission-element | 16 |
| html_rendering | 11 |
| html_semantics_forms | 9 |
| html_semantics_text-level-semantics | 2 |
| svg | 3 |
| html_semantics_embedded-content | 1 |
| **Total** | **75** |

Cross-checked all 75 against `tests/wpt/tests/MANIFEST.json` (SHA-256 prefix
`d5ec5be9bf1a75ed`, the same tree the lane used): every one carries a single
reference entry, relation `!=`, no manifest `fuzzy` extras, and no
alternate/chained reference. `final_ref` in `reftest.rs` does not walk
mismatch chains (correct per WPT semantics — a `!=` reference is terminal),
so chain-following is not a factor here, and none of the 75 has more than one
reference for the `refs.first()` simplification to drop.

**Sample rerun.** Built a fresh release runner:
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=C:/t/lane8c-target cargo build --release -p genet-wpt`,
SHA-256 `a96fb204d0a974133d128cb0c040fb765e6a89bb0a9f31089374c5c3092860a3`. Reran
14 of the 75 alone (`genet-wpt reftest <file> --engine boa --renderer livery
-v --tests-root tests/wpt/tests`), spanning 6 of the 7 directories above
(`html_rendering` x3, `html_semantics_forms` x2,
`html_semantics_permission-element` x2, `html_semantics_text-level-semantics`
x1, `html_semantics_embedded-content` x1, `mathml` x3, `svg` x2). All 14
reproduced `FAIL  mismatch` on the isolated rerun — no flake, no batch-run
artifact. A sample of 3 (`html/rendering/the-details-element/details-after.html`,
`mathml/relations/css-styling/mathbackground-001.html`,
`svg/text/reftests/lang-attribute.svg`) was also rendered with `genet-wpt
dump`; all three reported `diff=0% maxδ=0` between the candidate and
reference PNGs, confirming the pixels really are identical, not merely
within the widened GPU-jitter fuzzy band. Could not sample the `==` relation
or a runner-defect case, because none exists in this bucket: 75 of 75 are
`!=`, 0 are `==`, so there is only one relation to span. Dumped PNGs and the
rerun file list are under
`Code/testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-09-07_reftest_platform_sample/`.

**Verdict: no runner defect. All 75 are genuine `!=` engine failures.** Every
record in the bucket is a mismatch reftest whose candidate and reference
rendered the same picture — Livery did not distinguish the state the test
exists to probe (a details/summary open-state toggle, a checked/disabled
widget state, a permission-icon CSS property, a MathML `mathbackground`/
`mathcolor` value, stretchy operator sizing, an SVG `lang`/`xml:lang` text
render, and so on). The bucket is not a false-negative pool to reconcile
before spending effort on paint bugs, contrary to the hedge in the "Far
reading" note above — it *is* the paint-bug pool, just one where the feature
under test is entirely inert rather than partially wrong. `ports/genet-wpt`
was not touched.
