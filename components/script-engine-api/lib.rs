//! Engine-neutral scripting backend contract for genet's scripted tier.
//!
//! Lifted from the Track A (Boa) and Track B (Nova) validation probes — see
//! `docs/2026-05-20_genet_script_engine_plan.md`. The two findings the probes
//! proved are baked into the shape here:
//!
//! - The value surface (`eval`, value→string) and a native-data reflector are
//!   expressible with engine-native types (`JsValue`/`Context`, `Value`/`Agent`,
//!   `EmbedderObject`) fully confined to the backend crates.
//! - Reflector data is recovered by *value extraction* ([`reflector_data`]), not by
//!   invoking a JS method — because Nova's public API can't call a held function, so
//!   the cross-engine bridge has to read native data off a value directly.
//!
//! Backend selection is per-target: **Nova** native (primary), **Boa** on wasm32
//! (Nova is 64-bit-bound, Appendix B). Engines implement these traits; consumers
//! (`genet-scripted-dom`) drive them.
