//! Profile-neutral DOM trait.
//!
//! `LayoutDom` is the ID-first surface that Livery/Buckram (and other
//! read-only DOM walkers — reader-mode, serialization, querySelector helpers)
//! consume. It does not commit to a backing store: `genet-static-dom`'s
//! `StaticDocument` and a future scripted-DOM provider both implement it.
//!
//! Design rationale and prior art: see
//! `docs/2026-05-16_layout_dom_api_design.md`.
