//! Dynamic markup insertion and the document's readiness, as the small pieces
//! of state a native can reach.
//!
//! Two halves, and they are genuinely different:
//!
//! - **During a parse**, `document.write` is not a DOM operation at all: it
//!   inserts source at the *insertion point* of the tokenizer's input stream,
//!   immediately after the running script's own position. The native therefore
//!   only queues the text; the parser driver in [`crate::parse`] pops the queue
//!   when the script returns and pushes it onto the buffer queue, which is the
//!   spec's insertion point exactly. Nothing else can be correct — the DOM has
//!   no way to express "half an open tag".
//!
//! - **After a parse**, `document.write` implies `document.open`, which
//!   *replaces* the document — and then opens a source stream of its own. That
//!   stream is a real tokenizer over this same arena, built here and fed at its
//!   insertion point by each later write, so writes **append** instead of
//!   re-materializing the document, nodes keep their identity across two
//!   writes, and a `<script>` in written source runs.
//!
//! A native cannot re-enter the engine, so it cannot *run* that script itself.
//! The split is one function deep: `__docPumpStream` drives the tokenizer to
//! its next `<script>` and hands the source back to the bootstrap's own
//! `document.write`, which evaluates it and pumps again. The loop is therefore
//! in JavaScript, where re-entry is ordinary, and `document.write` stays
//! synchronous — the markup, and anything a written script did, is visible to
//! the next statement of the calling script.
//!
//! `document.currentScript` and `document.readyState` live here for the same
//! reason: they are host facts a native reads, set by the parser driver at the
//! spec's points rather than guessed by the bootstrap.
