//! Mutable scripted-DOM provider.
//!
//! `ScriptedDom` is the mutable sibling of `genet-static-dom`'s `StaticDocument`:
//! a `NodeId`-keyed arena that implements [`LayoutDom`] (read) and [`LayoutDomMut`]
//! (mutate), recording each structural change as a [`DomMutation`] for the
//! retained Livery document to translate into invalidation. The arena owns the
//! node data; JS reflectors bridge back to it by `NodeId` (via
//! `script-engine-api`'s `make_reflector`/`reflector_data`), so the engine never
//! owns DOM data.
//!
//! Scope (2026-05-23): structural mutation + the mutation stream. The reflector
//! bridge and Livery invalidation consumer now live above this render-neutral
//! arena. `set_inner_html` uses the shared fragment parser.
