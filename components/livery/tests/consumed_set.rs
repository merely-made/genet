//! F0's receipt: the consumed-longhand contract, asserted.
//!
//! The cutover plan's F0 stage closes the gap between Livery's catalog and the
//! 128 longhands the current Genet product path actually reads
//! (`docs/2026-07-13_genet_consumed_css_property_audit.md`). Its receipt is
//! "the census reads 128/128 consumed implemented".
//!
//! That receipt lives here on purpose. The import tool that first produced
//! the census needed a fork checkout, and both are deleted. This test reads
//! two checked-in files and nothing else.
