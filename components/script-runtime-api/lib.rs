//! Browser host surface for genet's scripted tier (the plan's Layer 1).
//!
//! Built ON the engine-neutral [`script_engine_api`] VM primitives
//! (`set_global` / `set_function` / host data), generic over the backend. The
//! "browser-ish" concepts — global scope (`self` / `window`), `console`, and
//! later the event loop, `EventTarget`, and `document` — are assembled here, not
//! in `script-engine-api`. If `document` or a timer ever appears in the VM trait,
//! the layering has failed.
//!
//! Present: aggregated [`HostState`] (the engine's single host-data slot) for
//! native sinks; global aliases (`self` / `window`); `console`; a cooperative
//! **event loop** (`setTimeout` / `setInterval` / `clear*`, drained by
//! [`Runtime::run_event_loop`]); **EventTarget** / `Event` (`addEventListener` /
//! `removeEventListener` / `dispatchEvent`); and the **`document` / `Node`
//! construction surface** (the `dom` module) — `createElement`, `createTextNode`,
//! `appendChild`, `setAttribute`, `textContent` (setter), `getElementById` —
//! bound to a [`genet_scripted_dom::ScriptedDom`] in host state. The event loop,
//! EventTarget, and DOM wrappers are JS bootstraps composed on the engine
//! primitives (the rakers lesson); the DOM mutators are native sinks reached the
//! same way as `console`. The only VM-trait growth needed was
//! `CallCx::make_reflector` (mint an outgoing node), added alongside the existing
//! `reflector_data` (recover an incoming one).
//!
//! Present: global scope (`self` / `window`), `console`, the event loop
//! (`setTimeout` / `setInterval`, drained by `run_event_loop` with microtask
//! checkpoints), global + node-level `EventTarget` with tree propagation,
//! `postMessage`, the `document` / `Node` surface, and a `testharness.js` results
//! bridge ([`Runtime::run_testharness`]). See
//! `docs/2026-05-26_pluggable_engines_testharness_plan.md`.
