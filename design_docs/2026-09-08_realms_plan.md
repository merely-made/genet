# Realms: one agent, one realm per browsing context

**Status (2026-09-13):** Canonical wrapper identity after source-realm disposal
is closed for ordinary nodes, nested open/closed shadow trees and template
contents. All 657 engine/runtime tests pass. Three headed runs per engine
preserve the previous digest and node census, prove detached collection, and
exit normally. See [Wrapper identity after disposal](#phase-wrapper-identity-after-disposal-2026-09-13)
for the matched WPT results and remaining boundaries.

**Earlier residual closure (2026-09-13):** Three residuals are closed: classic external scripts
after navigation, discarded `Location` URL behavior, and retired-host resource
teardown including Ortet's Boa exit. The strengthened headed G5 gate passes on
both engines. The current inventory and done-conditions are in
[Residual closure](#phase-residual-closure-2026-09-13).
Earlier phases retain their dated receipts and historical boundaries.

**Headed acceptance (2026-09-12):** **The full headed G5 acceptance is closed**, at
`11b61a0edab`, 2026-09-12 — see
[Phase: headed G5 acceptance](#phase-headed-g5-acceptance-2026-09-12), which
supersedes every "full headed G5 remains open" line below. A real Ortet window
on **both engines** drives a parent document and a same-origin child iframe
through the whole sequence: a subtree carrying an open shadow root, a nested
closed root and a parser-created template is adopted from the child into the
parent and back, the child is navigated twice and the top level once, and the
presented frame (`0x8df9c9b8815a6e22`, three consecutive matching captures per
engine), the published accessibility projection (the adopted link that ends up
in the parent projected as a `Link` with a `Click` action; the link adopted into
the child and navigated away absent from that same revision) and the live-node
census (`31` before and `31` after, across the top-level navigation) all agree.
It found and fixed one defect — a node could not outlive the realm it was born
in, `NoSuchRealm` on re-reflection after the source context was discarded — and
records four residuals by name: return-hop reflector identity, the unfetched
external script of a document reached by an in-session top-level navigation,
Ortet's lingering exit, and the compositing lane's digest instability, which is
now shown to reach `article.html` as well and to turn on **window size**, not
frame timing. **Still open:** a discarded context's `Location` reporting
`about:blank`; accessibility action *dispatch* for a scripted session; the three
named residuals above.

**Status:** **The top-level realm is replaced**, on `lane/top-level-realm` from
`546201874df`, 2026-09-12; the broad DOM guard is green since the associated-state transfer lane's repin. `MAIN_REALM` now means
only the agent's bootstrap realm — the timer queue, the navigation drive, the
`WindowProxy` factory, the one realm the engine refuses to discard — and the
top-level browsing context's document lives in a realm of its own, created
through the realm API with its `WindowProxy` as the global `this` from the
realm's first instruction, exactly as a child frame's is. The two are told apart
by the top context's absent `FrameRecord` and nothing else. One accessor,
`Runtime::top_realm()`, answers every top-document question across 41 migrated
call sites; `navigate_top_level` asks the host policy hook and past that
decision takes the child's route exactly, draining on the bootstrap realm
because that is the one realm guaranteed to outlive every document.
`Runtime::host()` keeps its signature — a navigation writes the new `HostState`
into the cell the embedder already holds — so no host changed a line. The
release runtime suite passes **558 tests with zero ignored**. The eight-subset,
2491-file census moves **no file in either direction** and exactly two subtests,
both in `no-browsing-context.window.html` and both former passes that depended
on the very defect this phase fixed; **no repins**, twelve of fourteen
testharness slices and both reftest guards at `unexpected=0`, with `dom` 61 and
`dom/nodes` 35 reproduced *exactly* by the base runner and left for the merge to
reconcile against `main`'s repins. Ortet's `article` digest is stable over three
runs and `frames` is bimodal at this base; an `ortet` built from the base commit
produces the identical six digests, so both are properties of the base rather
than of this lane. A discarded context's `Location` still does not report
`about:blank`, which is the next `Location` lane. Full G5 and associated
shadow/template transfers also remain open.

Earlier phases below retain their historical results, including the
WindowProxy-and-navigation status this line supersedes: that phase landed one
`WindowProxy` per context for its life, real child navigation through unload, a
new realm, a proxy rebind and an interleaved parse, session history with
`popstate`, and a release suite of 542 with zero ignored, and it recorded the
top-level realm as *not* replaced — the blocker this lane cleared.

Both lanes merged to main on 2026-09-12.

**Status:** Associated-state transfer landed on `lane/shadow-template-adoption`,
2026-09-12; **the broad DOM guard is green**. Shadow trees move with their hosts
(nested and closed roots, slot tables, `adoptedCallback` fan-out, `ownerDocument`
and reflector identity on both engines), template contents are re-homed
recursively onto the destination's inert owner, the parsing guard refuses only
subtrees intersecting the parser's stack of open elements or the form element
pointer, and `object` and `embed` join `iframe` in arriving as fresh frames — a
canvas with a live drawing context is the one named residual. The release
runtime suite passes **551 tests with zero ignored**. The census over `dom`,
`shadow-dom`, `custom-elements`, the template element and the iframe element
gains seven subtests across three files with **zero** pass-to-nonpass movements;
`dom_boa.json` and `dom_nodes_boa.json` are repinned **forward-only** (no former
pass demoted, no key dropped), which takes `dom` from 60 to 0 and `dom/nodes`
from 35 to 0, so **all fourteen testharness slices and both reftest guards sit at
`unexpected=0`**. Both Ortet receipts are unchanged by the lane, proved against a
build at the lane's own base rather than against the stale digest on record — see
the phase for that correction. Earlier phases below retain their historical
results.

Before it, WindowProxy and navigation landed on the working tree, 2026-09-11.
A browsing context holds one `WindowProxy` for
its life, built natively before its realm's first instruction over a shadow
target that retains no global, with the cross-origin decision made *inside* the
one object per accessing realm. A child navigates for real - `iframe.src`,
`location.href` / `assign` / `replace` / `reload`, and `contentWindow.location`
from the parent - through unload, a new realm, a new `Document`, a proxy rebind
and an interleaved parse, with fragment navigation keeping the document and
firing `hashchange`, and session history moved onto the browsing-context crate
with `popstate`. The outgoing realm is discarded every time, **including the
realm the proxy was built in**: both engines keep the handler, the shadow and the
control function alive after it goes, so no realm is retained. The release
runtime suite passes **542 tests with zero ignored**. The navigation census gains
19 named subtests and twelve files across nine directories with two
pass-to-nonpass movements, both former vacuous passes and both explained; **no
repins**, twelve of fifteen testharness slices and both reftest guards at
`unexpected=0`, every red one carrying the count it inherited, and both Ortet
receipts unchanged. **The top-level realm is not replaced**: `MAIN_REALM` is the
agent's root host, the resolution target of every `Runtime` entry point and the
one realm the engine refuses to discard, so replacing it is a `Runtime` API lane
rather than a navigation one - the host policy hook that gates a top-level
navigation exists and the document URL and session history move, but the realm
does not. Full G5 and associated shadow/template transfers also remain open.
Earlier phases below retain their historical results; final acceptance is
recorded at the end of this plan.

## Mark's decision, and what it revised

The iframes lane shipped under **one script `Runtime` per browsing context**
and then discovered that the ruling could not be honoured: two `Runtime`s are
two engine instances, this stack's cross-instance boundary marshals strings,
and a marshalled `contentWindow` cannot carry the object identity HTML requires
of a same-origin frame. Â§4 of that plan stopped rather than approximate it, and
put three options to Mark.

Mark's revised ruling:

> One `Runtime` per **agent** (the page's event loop), one **realm** per
> browsing context, created through a realm API on the engine contract
> implemented on Boa and Nova. Same-origin frames share the agent and hold
> direct references, so `iframe.contentWindow.document.getElementById(x)` is the
> child's own element with real identity; cross-origin access goes through a
> `WindowProxy` exposing only the allowed members and throwing `SecurityError`
> for the rest.

That is the browser shape, and it is the only one in which the same-origin case
is honest. This plan is its execution.

## 1. The realm contract â€” **landed**

`components/script-engine-api/lib.rs`. Additive: every method carries a default
that refuses, so `script-engine-piccolo` â€” which implements the trait and has no
realms â€” compiles unchanged and *says* `supports_realms() == false` rather than
silently answering from the main realm.

### The neutral surface

| Item | What it is |
|---|---|
| `RealmId` (`u32`) | Opaque, engine-assigned identity for a realm inside one engine instance. |
| `MAIN_REALM` (`0`) | The realm `ScriptEngine::new` builds; the one every non-realm-suffixed method acts on. |
| `RealmError` | `Unsupported` / `Refused(&'static str)` / `NoSuchRealm(id)` / `Engine(String)`. |
| `supports_realms` | Cheap capability probe, so a host can pick a degraded path before building anything. |
| `create_realm` / `discard_realm` | A realm with its own global object and its own intrinsics, sharing the engine's heap, job queue and host hooks. |
| `eval_in_realm` | Evaluate in a chosen realm; the value returned is usable from any realm of this engine. |
| `realm_global` | The child's **actual** global object as a value the parent may hold. The primitive `contentWindow` is built from. |
| `set_global_in_realm` / `set_function_in_realm` | The two install primitives, realm-scoped. `set_function_in_realm` reuses the same captures-free trampoline; only the global it lands on differs. |
| `set_host_data_in_realm` | Per-realm `HostData`. |
| `CallCx::current_realm` | Which realm this native callback is running in. |

### Three decisions worth their own line

**`RealmError` is deliberately not `ScriptEngine::Error`.** The defaults have to
be constructible without an engine, and â€” more importantly â€” a backend that
cannot do a piece has to be able to say *which* piece and *why*. `Refused` takes
a static string for exactly that: a recorded fact about the backend, not a
runtime failure to retry.

Continuation distinction: callback `eval_in_realm_from_call` and `call_from_call`
return `ScriptEngine::Error`, preserving original JavaScript exceptions and
thrown-object identity. `RealmError` remains the host-facing realm-operation error.

**Cross-realm handles need no API.** One engine instance is one **agent**: one
heap, one job queue, one `pump`. A `Self::Value` obtained in realm B is an
ordinary reference in realm A â€” a Nova `Global` is agent-wide, a Boa `JsValue`
is context-wide. So "hold a handle to another realm's objects across the
boundary" is not a marshalling problem here; it is the absence of one. The
regression set asserts it in both directions: a parent mutating an object it got
from the child is visible to the child, and `back === thing` inside the child is
`true` for a value that made the round trip.

**The realm is the host-state key, and the engine already holds it.** This is
the piece that makes phase 2 cheap. `set_host_data_in_realm` means a child
browsing context's realm carries its own `HostState` â€” its own document,
history, markup and pins â€” so every native sink that reaches state through
`CallCx::host_data` lands on the child's DOM **with no call-site change**. The
alternative, rekeying `HostState` by realm, would have touched ~123 sites across
`script-runtime-api` and made every sink learn that realms exist. Instead the
engine answers, because the engine is the only party that actually knows.

### Boa

`Context::create_realm` builds a realm with its own global and intrinsics on the
same heap and job queue; `enter_realm` swaps the active one (it replaces the
*current call frame's* realm, which is why `with_realm` restores on the error
path too); `Realm::host_defined` is a per-realm slot map. One `BoaEngine` is one
agent with as many realms as the host asks for.

Two facts found by doing it:

- **The reflector class is per-realm.** Boa's `host_classes` live on the
  `Realm`, so a realm that will be handed reflectors needs its own
  `register_global_class::<Reflector>()`; without it `Reflector::from_data` in
  that realm cannot find its prototype. `create_realm` does the registration and
  rolls the realm back out of the table if it fails.
- **`Realm::global_object` is `pub(crate)`.** The global is reachable only by
  *entering* the realm and asking the `Context`, which reads the active call
  frame's realm. Recorded rather than patched: the Boa fork under
  `Code/crates/boa` is outside this lane's scope.

### Nova

`GcAgent::create_default_realm` adds a realm to the same agent, `run_in_realm`
runs a closure inside a chosen one, and `[[HostDefined]]` is **already
per-realm** â€” which is why per-realm host state costs nothing on this backend.
`NovaHostSlot` gained an `id` field, and that is where a native sink learns its
own realm.

### The exact refusals

Recorded rather than approximated, per the brief.

| Backend | Refusal | Why, and whether it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Nova | `GcAgent::run_in_realm` asserts the execution-context stack is empty, so it **cannot nest**. A native callback in realm A cannot ask the host to enter realm B mid-call. | Does not block the design. Values are agent-wide, so reading and calling another realm's objects from inside a call goes through the ordinary object protocol, which pushes the callee's realm itself. Only a *host-driven* realm switch is refused, and only while a call is on the stack. Phase 2's per-realm surface must therefore install from the engine level, never from inside a sink. |
| Nova | At most **256 simultaneous realms** per agent (`RealmRoot` indexes a `u8`). | Surfaced as `RealmError::Refused` rather than a panic. A page with 256 live nested browsing contexts is out of scope; the cap is recorded so the failure is legible if it is ever hit. |
| Boa | `Realm::global_object` is crate-private. | Worked around by entering the realm. No behavioural cost. |
| Boa | `pump` still drains the *whole* job queue for the agent, budget or no (`SimpleJobExecutor` has no sub-drain). | Pre-existing and unchanged by realms. It is the right shape here â€” the job queue **is** agent-wide â€” but it means Boa cannot bound one realm's microtask storm separately from another's. |
| piccolo | No realms at all; takes the trait defaults. | Correct and honest: `supports_realms()` is `false` and every realm call returns `Unsupported`. |

### Named regression manifest â€” phase 1

Seven cases, twinned on both backends. Boa's live in
`components/script-engine-boa/lib.rs`'s test module; Nova's in
`components/script-engine-nova/tests/realms.rs`, asserted through the neutral
trait rather than through Nova types, so the pair is a real both-engine gate.

| Case | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `realms_have_separate_globals` | A binding in one realm is invisible in the other, both directions. |
| `realms_have_separate_intrinsics` | The child's `Object` is not the parent's â€” the reason a realm, not merely a fresh global, is the unit for a browsing context. |
| `objects_cross_realms_with_identity` | **Same-origin identity.** A child object read in the parent is the same object: mutating it in the parent is visible in the child, and `back === thing` in the child is `true`. This is the assertion the marshalled-proxy design could never satisfy. |
| `realm_global_is_the_childs_own_global` | `realm_global(child) === child's globalThis`, and writing through it is visible to the child. The `contentWindow` primitive. |
| `native_fn_sees_its_own_realm_and_host_data` | One `NativeFn` impl, two realms, two host states, two answers â€” and the callback never learns realms exist. The per-realm host surface in miniature. |
| `reflectors_cross_realms` | A reflector handed into another realm is still the same node to the host: the reflector bridge is agent-wide. |
| `realm_refusals_are_exact` | `NoSuchRealm` for an unknown id, `Refused` for discarding `MAIN_REALM`, and a discarded id stays discarded. |

Boa 14/14 (7 new + 7 existing), Nova 29/29 (7 new + 22 existing).

---

## 2. Per-realm host surface â€” **landed in the continuation**

### The shape

`Runtime::create_child_realm(...) -> RealmId` creates the realm, mints a fresh
`HostState` for the child document (bound to the child's arena from the
browsing-context tree), calls `set_host_data_in_realm`, and runs
`install_host_surface` scoped to that realm with `GlobalScopeKind::Window`.

The implemented agent shares task scheduling and microtask execution. Each
realm host retains fetch completion, worker routing, document, location and DOM
bookkeeping; the browsing-context tree retains session history.

### The one refactor it needs, sized

`install_host_surface` and the twelve `install_*_surface` functions take
`engine: &mut E` and â€” this is the load-bearing measurement â€” use **only two**
engine methods between them: `set_function::<F>` and `eval`. There are 16
`engine: &mut E` signatures and 243 call sites of those two methods.

So the change is a facade, not a rewrite:

```rust
// Illustrative, not compile-ready.
pub(crate) struct Surface<'e, E: ScriptEngine> { engine: &'e mut E, realm: RealmId }
impl<'e, E: ScriptEngine> Surface<'e, E> {
    fn eval(&mut self, src: &str) -> Result<E::Value, SurfaceError<E::Error>>;
    fn set_function<F: NativeFn<E>>(&mut self, name: &str, len: usize)
        -> Result<(), SurfaceError<E::Error>>;
}
```

Sixteen signatures change; the 243 call sites do not. `SurfaceError` exists
because the realm methods return `RealmError` and `E::Error` cannot be
constructed from one â€” and the main-realm path is structurally unable to produce
the `Realm` variant, since `Surface { realm: MAIN_REALM }` dispatches to the
non-realm methods.

**Nova's non-nesting refusal constrains this**: the install must be driven from
the engine level, never from inside a native sink.

### Done-conditions

- A child realm carries a full DOM surface (`document`, `Node`, `Element`,
  events, the interface table) bound to the child's own arena.
- A runtime regression, on **both** backends: two realms, two documents; an
  element created in the child is invisible to `document.getElementById` in the
  parent and visible in the child.
- Timers scheduled in either realm run on the one agent loop, in a deterministic
  order the scheduler trace records.
- The existing `script-runtime-api` suite (15 binaries, 142 lib tests) is
  unchanged.

---

## 3. `contentWindow`, `contentDocument`, `postMessage` â€” **landed in the continuation and navigation phases**

### The design

`contentWindow` on an `HTMLIFrameElement` is the child realm's global
(`realm_global`) when the origins are same-origin, and a `WindowProxy` otherwise.
`contentDocument` is the child realm's `document` when same-origin, `null`
otherwise â€” HTML says `null`, not a throw.

`parent`, `top`, `frames[i]` become real; `window.opener` stays `null` (nothing
in this host opens a window); `frameElement` follows the origin rules â€” the
container element same-origin, `null` cross-origin.

### The `WindowProxy`

The cross-origin case is a **whitelist**, not a filtered view of the child. The
allowed set is HTML's `CrossOriginProperties`: `window`, `self`, `location`
(write-only through the setter, and `location.href` write-only), `close`,
`closed`, `focus`, `blur`, `frames`, `length`, `top`, `opener`, `parent`,
`postMessage`, and `Symbol.toStringTag` / `Symbol.hasInstance` /
`Symbol.isConcatSpreadable`, with the allowed `then` fallback. Other protected
reads throw `SecurityError`. The implementation exposes the permitted Location
descriptor shape, but Location writes and `replace()` remain unsupported and
throw; navigation remains open.

Two rules the implementation must not soften:

- **Throw, do not answer plausibly.** A cross-origin read of a non-allowed
  member is a `SecurityError`, never `undefined`. `undefined` on both sides of
  an equality is the `Node-baseURI` pass-by-absence failure, and the
  cross-origin WPT files are exactly the tests that would report it as green.
- **The proxy is per (realm, target) pair.** HTML requires the same
  `WindowProxy` object for the same pair. Implemented cross-origin views are
  cached by target in each viewer realm's private JS `Map`; they do not use the
  reflector cache.

### Reflector homing â€” the piece that must be got right

Child DOM methods return their original canonical wrappers. Native reflector
caches and root bookkeeping are realm-scoped, preventing equal raw IDs from
separate document arenas from aliasing. A read from another realm retains that
object's identity and creation-realm prototypes.

This is the phase-3 risk. A reflector minted in the *caller's* realm would make
`parent.frames[0].document.body === childScript.document.body` false while every
other assertion in the file passed, and that is a wrong answer that scores well.

`postMessage` between realms uses the **structured clone across realms** â€” the
existing clone walker, not the Worker lane's JSON wire, since inside one agent
there is no wire to cross. `MessageEvent.source` is the sender's `WindowProxy`.
Events retarget across realms; the child's `load` fires on the parent's
`<iframe>` element.

### Done-conditions

- Named regressions on both backends: **same-origin identity**
  (`iframe.contentWindow.document.getElementById(x)` is `===` the node the
  child's own script holds) and **cross-origin `SecurityError`** (a
  non-whitelisted read throws, and the whitelisted ones do not).
- `postMessage` across realms delivers a structured clone with the correct
  `source` and `origin`; a cycle survives.
- The child's `load` fires on the parent's iframe element, once.
- A census over the nine directories with every `pass -> fail` explained.

---

## 4. Security â€” **core checks landed; `document.domain` remains open**

Same-origin comparison comes from the browsing-context tree's `Origin`
(`components/genet-documents/src/browsing_context.rs`), which the iframes lane
already built with the two things this needs: an opaque origin carrying a serial
(so two `about:blank` documents are *not* same-origin) and `initial_about_blank`
as a bit rather than a URL test.

Sandbox flags, already parsed there from the attribute's inverted token list and
inherited as a union:

- `allow-same-origin` absent â‡’ the child gets an opaque origin â‡’ every
  `contentWindow` access is the cross-origin `WindowProxy` path.
- `allow-scripts` absent â‡’ the child's realm is created but **no script runs in
  it**. Note the interaction HTML calls out: a sandbox with both
  `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin` can remove its own sandbox attribute,
  which is why the two together are not a safe combination and why the flags are
  read at *load* time, not at access time.

`document.domain` remains a residual, as the iframes lane and the scoping
document both already named. It is the one same-origin-domain mutation this
model does not have, and it would move a realm between agent clusters at
runtime.

---

## Findings

**2026-09-08 â€” a realm is the smallest unit that carries intrinsics.** The
distinction that makes a realm the right object here, rather than "a second
global", is `realms_have_separate_intrinsics`: the child's `Object` is not the
parent's. HTML depends on it (`instanceof` across frames is false, and every
`Array.isArray`-style cross-realm brand check exists because of it), and a fresh
global on shared intrinsics would have passed the global-separation test while
failing every brand check.

**2026-09-08 â€” per-realm host state is the engine's answer, not the host's.**
The obvious design was to key `HostState` by realm and teach every native sink
to ask which realm it is in: ~123 coupling sites in `script-runtime-api`, every
one a chance to forget. The engine already knows the realm â€” it *is* the
execution context â€” so putting `HostData` in the realm's own slot moves the key
to the one party that cannot get it wrong, and leaves the sinks unchanged. Boa
needed a `RealmSlot` added; Nova already had exactly this shape.

**2026-09-08 â€” an engine's realm switch may be nestable or not, and the
difference decides where installation happens.** Boa's `enter_realm` is a frame
field swap and nests freely. Nova's `GcAgent::run_in_realm` asserts an empty
execution-context stack and cannot. Since the contract must hold on both, the
per-realm surface has to be installed from the engine level; a design that
installed lazily from inside a native sink would have worked on Boa and asserted
on Nova. This is the cross-target lesson in a new place: a green build on one
backend proves nothing about the other's execution model.

**2026-09-08 â€” a purely additive trait change is still worth a census, and the
lockfile digest is the control that makes the result readable.** The `pre` and
`post` runners produced a byte-identical `Cargo.lock`
(`6a74d1efâ€¦`), which is what lets "zero movement across nine directories"
be read as *this change moved nothing* rather than *two effects cancelled*.
Without the lockfile control it would only have been a coincidence with good
manners.

## Before / after

| Surface | Before (`4039b859c77`) | After |
|---|---|---|
| Realms on the engine contract | none â€” `ScriptEngine` had no realm concept | `RealmId`, `MAIN_REALM`, `RealmError`, eight trait methods and `CallCx::current_realm`, all defaulted to a stated refusal |
| Boa | one realm, one global, one context-wide host-data slot | many realms, per-realm reflector class, per-realm `HostData`, per-realm native functions |
| Nova | one realm; `[[HostDefined]]` per-realm but only ever one realm | many realms (cap 256, surfaced as a refusal), realm id carried in the host slot, per-realm `HostData` |
| piccolo | implements `ScriptEngine` | unchanged; `supports_realms() == false` and every realm call `Unsupported` |
| Cross-realm object identity | not expressible | proven on both backends, both directions |
| `contentWindow` | the iframes lane's stub: a fresh empty document, no browsing-context link | **unchanged** â€” phase 3 |
| WPT, nine directories | see `pre/` | identical: `subtest_delta 0`, zero status movement |

## Progress

**2026-09-08.** Phase 1 landed: the realm contract on the engine-neutral trait,
implemented on Boa and Nova, with seven twinned regressions on each and every
backend refusal recorded rather than approximated. Zero WPT movement across nine
directories against a runner-controlled baseline with an identical lockfile
digest; both baseline guards and both Ortet receipts unchanged. Phases 2â€“4 are
specified above with done-conditions and are not started; the per-realm surface
is sized (16 signatures, 243 call sites, two engine methods) and the
reflector-homing risk in phase 3 is named.

## Continuation, 2026-09-09 â€” in progress

The inherited six-file patch was preserved at HEAD `640477b6138`. A fresh
pre runner was built before editing the integration tree. Its SHA-256 is
`bd2adaddfe934f93b65fa7480a8009d5e58f8e6d1f95c038f1fd9348e99d5ee2`;
Cargo.lock is `6a74d1efa0398509a9693b34bfcbbc0f4760284caf0d3a38bd5f65742fc57e5d`.
The nine-directory pre census completed successfully. Files, maps and inherited
patch snapshots are under `Code/testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-09-09_realms-continuation/`.

### Corrected findings

- Platform objects have a relevant realm; accessing a child object does not
  authorize minting another public DOM wrapper in the caller. The earlier
  "one wrapper per realm" explanation above was misleading. The child's own
  methods must return its original JS object and its own prototypes.
- Boa's old context-wide reflector cache could alias equal raw node IDs from
  different arenas in release builds. Debug arena tags concealed that case.
  The continuation scopes canonical caches and root bookkeeping to each realm.
- Nova's child promise counters collided while settlement and GC bookkeeping
  still searched main. Pending promise identity is agent-wide; reflector roots
  and death reports are realm-scoped.
- `GcAgent::run_in_realm` is an outer-entry restriction. Nova's public
  `Agent::create_realm` and `run_script` support synchronous creation inside a
  native callback. No preallocated realm pool or delayed empty window is needed.
- Nova child realms use `Global<Realm>` roots in the continuation, so the old
  256-`RealmRoot` limit does not describe this new path.
- A JavaScript-visible shared timer object exposes foreign callback functions
  and their constructors. The queue handle is retained by the host and passed
  privately during installation, then removed from each global.
- `BrowsingContextTree`, origins and sandbox flags moved into the lower
  `browsing-context-api` crate. `genet-documents::browsing_context` reexports
  that owner; runtime depends downward on it without a documents/runtime cycle.
- Direct native messaging needs caller provenance. Small local Boa/Vano fork
  APIs expose the nearest authored ECMAScript caller, skipping native call/apply
  trampolines, with separate focused tests. This is
  explicitly not a complete implementation of HTML incumbent settings across
  arbitrary host callback stacks; the continuation must not claim that scope.

### Current gates

The corrected aggregate run passed 667 tests with none failed or ignored:
script-runtime-api 446, genet-scripted 112 (110 library plus two integration),
genet-documents 49, Boa adapter 22 and Nova adapter 38. This includes the
interface-table drift check, lazy loading and arena-locality regressions.
Receipt: `test-post-census-final.log`. Engine API has no tests; the unchanged
Piccolo adapter previously passed 10/10 and browsing-context-api 13/13.
The focused local Boa caller regression and both Vano fork regressions passed
before the final locality field; the final Nova suite covers locality through GC.

Clippy passed all touched Genet crates with no errors (warnings remain in the
log). Rustfmt passed all touched Rust files. Workspace check with
`genet-wpt/netfetch` and the corrected release build passed. The final post census is net +222 subtest passes, with four valid adoption
assertions still failing and one removed duplicate registration. Twelve of
fourteen testharness slices pass after three forward-only repins; dom and
dom/nodes remain red. Both reftest slices have unexpected=0. Ortet article
matches three times; frames matches on three consecutive captures after the
one-pixel outlier documented below.

An external writer committed the shared integration tree as `aa12e16eb7c`
(`Realms on the engine contract, phase one`) while continuation verification
was still running. The coordinator did not create this commit. It includes
the in-progress per-realm surface and frame integration, so its title does
not establish a phase boundary or a green gate. Later fixes remain working
tree changes. The required pre/post runner comparison still uses the captured
pre source above, with the final post source recorded separately.

Current measured continuation receipts include 24 frame acceptance tests, 8
cross-origin reflection tests, 18 clone/exception tests, 6 host/task-routing tests,
4 animation-frame tests and 2 descriptor tests, all on both engines. The first
hosted both-engine run was 106 passed / 4 failed; the final combined run above
supersedes that diagnostic snapshot.
The final verification tree is f949210ca32 plus the recorded realms patch.

### Continuation implementation and remaining boundaries (2026-09-09)

The continuation uses one engine and one agent task drive. `AgentState` retains
per-realm hosts; each host owns its document and location. A private rooted task
state joins timers and animation callbacks without exposing foreign callback
objects to script. Fetch completion and worker routing retain their realm.
`frames.rs` creates the child realm synchronously on connected iframe insertion,
using the canonical origins and sandbox flags in `browsing-context-api`.

Same-origin `contentWindow` exposes the actual child global. Child DOM methods
return the child's canonical wrappers. Cross-origin windows use a viewer-realm
proxy with explicit read, reflection and mutation rules. Messaging records are
serialized in the sender and decoded with recipient intrinsics; `source` is
resolved for the recipient's origin. Native caller provenance follows authored
script through call/apply trampolines. This is not the complete HTML backup
incumbent-settings stack.

The hosted Livery route installs child CSSOM before authored scripts and paints
the child's live arena into the parent's iframe slot. Its regression changes
the child DOM from the parent and checks the resulting scene.

Named continuation regression manifest (each runtime case runs on Boa and Nova):

| File under `components/script-runtime-api/tests/` | Boundary |
|---|---|
| `frame_realms.rs` | Synchronous creation; `child_script_and_parent_share_node_identity`; parent/top/frameElement; `cross_origin_window_rejects_non_whitelisted_reads`; independent sandbox origin/script flags; one load event; recipient clone/source; borrowed postMessage receiver and caller |
| `frame_window_security.rs` | Cross-origin Window and Location reflection and allowed-member access |
| `realms.rs` | Separate documents, shared timer ordering, child fetch completion |
| `realm_animation_frames.rs` | Shared drive and private callbacks |
| `realm_clone.rs` | Recipient intrinsics, cycles/aliases/buffers, worker wire compatibility, inert records, captured intrinsics, accessor refusal, identity-based DOM wrapper branding |

The Boa/Vano fork tests additionally cover native caller provenance and Vano
foreign builtin prototypes across realm removal and collection. Local fork
patches are required; the public git dependency alone does not contain them.

Open boundaries remain: navigation with a stable WindowProxy, complete removed-
frame lifecycle cleanup, full HTML incumbent-settings behavior, dynamic DOM
ordering of animation callbacks, and `document.domain`. These are not accepted
by the bounded creation, identity, scheduling, messaging and rendering tests.
The final census and guard results below apply to this continuation and retain
its unresolved adoption failures.

### Verification checkpoint, 2026-09-09

The full runtime run completed with 418 passes and 14 failures. All 52 new
focused tests passed on that snapshot. Six failures exposed Window.parent missing its [Replaceable] setter; original
fixtures are retained and the descriptor is being corrected against html.idl.
Two failures require installing the fixture style provider on the child host.
Six further failures
exposed missing messaging trace marks, undefined payload conversion, and flattened
exception types. Corrections require a fresh runtime run. The nested-frame load
ordering regression was added after that snapshot and is also pending.

The focused Boa native-caller test passed. Both exact Vano fork tests passed
through Genet's dependency graph, including native TypeError/ReferenceError
creation-realm prototypes. Temporary fork test targets were removed afterward.
The new browsing-context-api crate passed all 13 tests. Post census and final
acceptance remain open. Another writer committed in-progress integration as
`aa12e16eb7c`; this coordinator has made no commits.

### Parser and initial-load completion correction (2026-09-09)

A scriptless parent did not discover parser-inserted iframes before returning
from parsing. Its first contentWindow read created the realm after the host had
already pumped tasks. Parser completion now refreshes that discovery before
readiness events. When child initial loads remain, the parent stays Interactive;
final child completion advances Complete and dispatches load once. Removing a
pending iframe cancels only its initial source/events and releases this wait.
The retained realm still follows the separately open teardown/lifetime boundary.

The hosted child-paint fixture also misread fragment_rect's [x, y, width, height]
contract. Its dimension assertions now use width/height directly; the requested
20/75/30 sizes and paint assertions are retained. Focused hosted tests passed 2/2
and frame tests passed 22/22 before adding the pending-removal case. The complete
runtime/hosted rerun in test-runtime-hosted-final.log includes that final case;
passed all 554 tests and supersedes the earlier full-run failures.

### Static document fixture corrections (2026-09-09)

The separate script-free document suite initially passed 47/49. Its append and
submission fixture clicked the start-caret text anchor before expecting an
append; it now sends End explicitly. Its input-rejection fixture reused retained
geometry after focus invalidated layout; it now renders before each subsequent
hit query and final sequential-focus action. The original HTML and all behavior
assertions remain. These corrections change tests only. The rerun passed 49/49
in `test-documents-corrections.log`. The rejected intrinsic-sizing hypothesis in
the diagnostic log is superseded by the reproduced stale-layout cause.

### Census-driven corrections and the adoption acceptance boundary

The initial continuation census is preserved as `post-initial/`, with its runner
`genet-wpt-post-initial.exe` (SHA-256
`5e5879d10995104a0f663ae3ffa234cc2482726afc94cb094807ccf5dac22251`).
It gained 230 named subtest passes and lost 21, net +209. This is a diagnostic
snapshot, not an accepted baseline repin.

Two issues were reproduced. The runtime recorded `loading=lazy` but still
acquired and scheduled the child source. Lazy contexts now retain their initial
about:blank window and inherited origin while deferring source acquisition,
scripts and load events. They do not delay ancestor load. This matches the
existing static loader policy; viewport-triggered or lazy-to-eager activation
is not implemented by this slice.

Real child documents also exposed cross-arena node adoption. Passing a
parent-created Node to a child-native DOM method treated its raw identity as a
slot in the child arena. Optimized builds could alias a different node or panic;
debug builds could trip the arena fence. `CallCx::reflector_is_local` now checks
immutable native provenance on both engines, independently of raw ids or public
prototypes. Runtime DOM entry points reject a foreign arena before dereferencing
its NodeId. The authored append/adopt path reports WrongDocumentError before
detachment or ownerDocument changes. Same-arena secondary-document adoption and
ordinary access to child-created objects retain their existing behavior.

This refusal prevents corruption; it does not implement cross-arena adoption.
The owning-document/store migration remains the G5 boundary documented in
`docs/2026-06-11_gc_arena_dom_plan.md`. Prior valid adoption passes cannot be
removed from checked baselines to accept this continuation. Final census and
guard receipts below must keep this distinction explicit.

Named new regressions: `tests/frame_lazy.rs` and
`tests/frame_arena_boundary.rs`, each on Boa and Nova (4/4 focused runtime tests
passed). Adapter `reflector_locality_uses_owner_not_raw_id` tests canonical and
uncached equal raw ids, prototype changes, non-reflectors and forced GC. The
Vano embedder-object provenance field is native, cloned with heap snapshots and
ignored by GC tracing. No clone-by-value fallback is used for Node adoption.

### Final continuation census (2026-09-09)

The final disk/Boa/Livery census completed all nine directories with eight
workers and a 240-second process timeout. Each map's runner digest was checked
against the executable. Source is `f949210ca32` plus
`post-final-genet-source.patch` and the local Boa/Vano patches in the continuation
ledger. The last change after the 667-test aggregate was the specified
HierarchyRequestError for cross-document moveBefore; its focused Boa/Nova
regressions, clippy, workspace check and fresh release build passed.

| Runner | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| Pre, inherited phase-one source at `640477b6138` | `bd2adaddfe934f93b65fa7480a8009d5e58f8e6d1f95c038f1fd9348e99d5ee2` |
| Final post | `f3ccc4454686b5612d0588cba41e823db201397fe5647d9a0d7ee0f62d19f598` |

The post lockfile digest is
`e64b015a646a1b628d17b1658cedf9e4a445ab3d40b522d61345f9d19c22e05d`.
Its only changes from the captured pre lockfile are the new browsing-context-api
package and dependency edges from genet-documents and script-runtime-api.
Dependency versions are unchanged. Required local fork heads and file hashes
are recorded in `post-final-source-hashes.json`.

| Directory | Passing subtests before | After | Delta | Files gained / lost |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `dom` | 46,391 | 46,528 | +137 | 5 / 1 |
| `html/browsers/origin` | 2 | 12 | +10 | 2 / 0 |
| `html/browsers/sandboxing` | 0 | 0 | +0 | 0 / 0 |
| `html/browsers/the-window-object` | 69 | 83 | +14 | 3 / 0 |
| `html/browsers/windows` | 4 | 7 | +3 | 2 / 0 |
| `html/dom` | 42,334 | 42,377 | +43 | 1 / 0 |
| `html/semantics/embedded-content/the-iframe-element` | 17 | 23 | +6 | 1 / 0 |
| `webmessaging` | 160 | 169 | +9 | 5 / 0 |
| `workers` | 325 | 325 | +0 | 0 / 0 |

Total: 227 newly passing named subtests, five lost recorded passes, net +222;
19 files gain all-pass status and one loses it. Four losses are valid assertions
that require cross-arena adoption; they remain acceptance failures:

| File | Former pass now failing |
|---|---|
| `dom/nodes/Node-appendChild.html` | Adopting an orphan |
| `dom/nodes/Node-isConnected.html` | Test with iframes (also the sole all-pass file regression) |
| `html/browsers/the-window-object/accessing-other-browsing-contexts/window_length.html` | Child browsing context has a child browsing context |
| `html/dom/partial-updates/tentative/template-for-html-setters.html` | Setter createContextualFragment should not patch existing target in head |

The fifth recorded loss is occurrence two of the top-level frameElement-null
assertion in `html/browsers/windows/nested-browsing-contexts/frameElement.sub.html`.
The fixture defines four tests once; the pre map contains all four registrations
twice, while the post map contains one copy of each. The unique assertion still
passes. The duplicate count is preserved as a named movement, not silently
removed from the comparison.

Forward-only repin: `ports/genet-wpt/expectations/testharness/dom_abort_boa.json`,
only `dom/abort/reason-constructor.html`, fail 0/1 to pass 1/1:
"AbortSignal.reason.constructor should be from iframe". A fresh exact-subset
candidate measured 13 files and 59/72 passing subtests; all former named passes
and membership were retained. `dom_boa` and `dom_nodes_boa` remain unchanged
because each contains the two regressed adoption entries. Their unpromoted gains
and losses are listed in `baseline-review.json`; H4 opt-in membership is unchanged.
The completed guard and native Ortet results follow.

### Final gates, repins and retained failures

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Aggregate runtime, hosted, document and Boa/Nova suites | 667 passed, zero failed or ignored; `test-post-census-final.log` |
| Last localized moveBefore exception correction | Four focused runtime cases passed on Boa/Nova; `test-final-move-error.log` |
| Engine API, Piccolo, browsing-context-api | API has zero tests; unchanged Piccolo 10/10 and browsing-context-api 13/13 passed earlier |
| Clippy and workspace check | Passed, warnings recorded; final runtime clippy and workspace check rerun after the localized correction |
| Rustfmt and diff whitespace checks | Passed |
| Final release runner and nine-directory census | Complete, exact runner digest verified in every post map |
| Original testharness guard | Failed on dom, unexpected=44; `guard-testharness-final.log` |
| Remaining testharness slices | Audited with eight workers and the same 30-second timeout; after reviewed repins, twelve of fourteen slices are unexpected=0. dom/nodes remains red with dom. |
| Reftest guards | Both unexpected=0: mediaqueries 16 pass / 40 fail; css-position 45 pass / 73 fail |
| Ortet article | Three captures at `0x6377ba8a6bf4dbc9`, unchanged |
| Ortet frames | Runs 2â€“4 exactly match `0x97bdd4bd9e03ec02`; initial one-pixel outlier retained |

Two additional forward-only repins record completed failures, without gaining or
losing passing assertions:

- `css_mediaqueries_boa.json`: `media-query-matches-in-iframe.html`, the
  aspect-ratio change-event assertion, not-run to fail; and
  `mq-dynamic-empty-children.html`, its dynamic-media-query assertion, timeout
  to fail. Fresh subset: 86/384 subtests, 93 files.
- `css_animations_boa.json`:
  `responsive/fill-forwards-viewport-units.html`, "fill: forwards with viewport
  units updates on viewport resize", timeout to fail. Fresh subset: 360/1219
  subtests, 231 files.

Both exact-subset checks passed with unexpected=0 after repinning. Together with
the abort-constructor improvement, this is three baseline files and four named
entries. All old passing assertions and exact membership were preserved.
`baseline-review.json` retains the unpromoted broad DOM changes. The original
guard reports those newly measured outcomes as well as the adoption regressions;
its failure must not be described as a green ratchet.

The original 30-second guard also killed `dom/ranges/Range-mutations-dataChange.html`.
A sequential single-file control killed both the pre runner (31.52 seconds wall)
and the final post runner (30.69 seconds wall) at the same 30-second cap. Both
240-second census maps complete that file at 2328/2808 passing subtests. This
failure is not specific to the continuation. The timeout and expectation remain
unchanged; `range-30s-pre/post.json` and their logs retain the control.

The first frames capture was `0x14e0e60a47fe2be3`. Compared with the archived
iframe-lane reference it differs at one pixel, (347,356), in the parent's caption:
RGBA (169,163,155,255) became (169,163,154,255). Geometry and child-frame pixels
match. Captures 2, 3 and 4 exactly match the reference; `ortet/pixel-comparison.json`
and all images/logs preserve the outlier. Three consecutive matching captures
meet the repeat check, but this fixture is not unconditionally byte-stable.

No new architectural ruling was substituted for Mark's one-Runtime-per-agent
decision. Completing cross-arena DOM adoption and ownership-aware routing is the
next required implementation boundary; stable WindowProxy navigation, full
teardown, incumbent settings, dynamic rAF ordering, lazy-frame activation and
document.domain remain separately open. This continuation is not accepted as a
closed realms lane. The coordinator created no commits or stashes.


### Cross-arena adoption foundation (verified, 2026-09-09)

Mark authorized working on the adoption blocker after the continuation report.
The first implementation boundary is permanent node identity and detached
storage transfer. It does not enable authored `adoptNode` or insertion across
arenas. The four named WPT regressions above remain acceptance failures until
the complete runtime mutation and lifetime path is implemented.

**Identity.** `NodeId` becomes an opaque u64 on every target: a checked 24-bit
allocation-arena namespace and 40-bit monotonic serial. Namespace and serial
exhaustion fail before reuse. Native host, reflector, accessibility and render
boundaries carry the full value. Storage keys preserve the complete identity;
physical membership, rather than birth namespace, determines the owning store.
Capture/replay keeps an explicit local-serial translation and refuses imported
identities until an import translation exists.

**Transfer.** `ScriptedDom::transfer_detached_subtree_to` preflights an ordinary
detached subtree before moving its records with unchanged IDs. It returns the
moved IDs for host ownership/root relocation. Pending source work, documents,
shadow/template/slot state, invalid trees and collisions are refused before
mutation. This lower-level operation does not implement DOM adoption steps or
move JS wrappers, ranges, observer registrations, script state or live iframe
contexts. Runtime cross-arena refusal remains in place.

**Foundation verification:** 674 distinct native tests pass with zero failures
and zero ignored: 448 script-runtime-api, 112 genet-scripted, 49 genet-documents
and 65 store tests. The same 65 store tests also pass in release, including
refusal atomicity, round-trip transfer, pin relocation and reclamation. Both
engines preserve an odd ID above 2^53 through host dispatch and GC. The wasm32
store probe compiles and executes in Node v24.11.0 without host imports,
preserving `9011597301252097` through its u64 boundary and checking transfer and
reclamation. This standalone probe has its own archived lockfile; it is not
browser-hosted realm acceptance.

The interface-table drift test, workspace check with `genet-wpt/netfetch`,
Clippy on the storage/runtime/document crates and formatting checks pass;
warnings remain recorded. A release control using the original f949210ca324
store sources fails as expected because two stores both identify their root
as `NodeId(0)`. Final sources, inherited patches, locks and logs are recorded in
`testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-09-09_dom-adoption-foundation` outside the repo.
The WPT harness binary unit suite additionally passes 69 tests with its three
existing manifest/test262/diagnostic ignores retained; the worker library suite
passes all four tests on each native backend. The workspace lock is
unchanged. This slice performs no fresh WPT census,
baseline repin or headed rendering receipt.

**Next runtime boundary:** maintain NodeId-to-current-owner independently of
NodeId-to-creation-realm. Route every node read and mutation to the former,
return canonical wrappers through the latter, and relocate pin/death accounting
before collection. Source and destination range/observer state must participate
in one semantic adoption operation. Removing only the append/adopt guard is
insufficient. Shadow/template ownership, capture translation and instantiated
iframe movement require their own explicit supported semantics.


**Runtime coordination inventory, 2026-09-09.** Review of the actual bootstrap
confirms that `__listeners` and handler properties belong to the retained
wrapper. A second listener registry is unnecessary. `Node.dispatchEvent` must
end its propagation path at the current root document's `defaultView`; its
creation-realm `globalThis.window` becomes wrong after adoption. `ownerDocuments`
and custom-element upgrade/connection maps need coordination in each affected
wrapper realm. Range endpoints belong to Range objects, but `rangeIndex` and
mutation hooks must reach every realm indexing affected nodes. Observer
registrations (`node.__moRegs`) follow the wrapper; destination capture interest
and source-created observers' pending records/notification queues must remain
connected. Neither observer nor Range participation can be inferred solely
from the node's wrapper realm.

The next private agent boundary therefore separates current host ownership,
canonical wrapper realm, trusted rooted per-realm coordination hooks, and
node-indexed Range/observer participants. No new public mutation API is needed.
DOM [adopting steps](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-adopt), checked
2026-09-09, additionally require descendant and attribute document ownership,
shadow-tree handling and custom-element reactions. Storage transfer alone does
not supply them. Existing authored adoption refusals remain explicit until the
semantic boundary and its two-engine identity/observer/range tests pass.


### Runtime cross-arena adoption (in verification, 2026-09-09)

**Status:** implementation is in the working tree; new runtime gates are still
running. This phase supersedes the foundation's authored-adoption refusal for
ordinary subtrees only. It does not close the enclosing realms lane.

The private agent coordinator in `script-runtime-api/dom/adoption.rs` resolves
physical storage ownership independently of each node's creation realm. Genuine
reflectors are origin-checked before routing. Canonical wrappers, their original
prototypes, expandos and listeners remain in the creation realm. Private rooted
per-realm hooks coordinate owner documents, custom-element reactions, ranges,
observer delivery and GC groups; snapshot restores re-register their own cloned
hooks. Failed realm installation drops its hooks and failed reflection does not
commit a storage pin.

Adoption preflights the complete ordinary subtree before detachment, consumes
source observer records, preserves pending layout invalidation records, moves
storage with stable IDs, and relocates pins and already-started script state.
Insertion validation precedes removal, including document child count/order and
reference membership. Native multi-node mutation sinks refuse mixed owners that
bypass this transaction. Replacement observer groups follow the destination
owner, with agent-side nesting; delivery waits until the group closes. Fresh
adopted scripts prepare in the destination realm, and event bubbling ends at the
current document's window.

GC resolves physical components across creation realms before collection and
retires dead-reflector pins at their current owner. Retaining only a descendant
must retain ancestor/sibling wrappers and their state; releasing all script roots
must allow reclamation. Retained layout consumers tolerate transferred nodes in
old mutation records while invalidating the source and destination parents.

**Done-conditions:** both-engine adoption/identity, observer, range, script,
replacement, native-boundary and reclamation regressions pass; snapshot and
engine callback-root tests pass; touched-crate tests, table drift, workspace
check, Clippy and formatting complete; exact-source receipts distinguish fresh
WPT evidence from historical realm census results.

**Remaining boundaries:** associated shadow/template/slot trees and iframe,
object, embed and canvas ownership transfer still refuse explicitly. Active
parser/observer-group transfers refuse. Host document stream operations borrowed
across arenas refuse before mutation. Capture import translation, full browsing
context teardown/navigation and native headed G5 acceptance remain open. The
initial coordinator scans hosts for ownership and fans participant hooks out to
same-origin realms; this is a correctness path, not a measured scalability claim.

Verification logs and final source receipts belong under
`Code/testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-09-09_dom-adoption-runtime`. Until the results
below are recorded, this phase has no passing runtime acceptance claim.


**Verification progress, 2026-09-10:** the storage suite passes 68 tests in debug.
The first integrated runtime run passed all 8 replacement, 4 associated-tree/
full-width identity, 2 native-bypass and 6 owner-native-boundary cases. Its five
identity/lifetime failures exposed incorrect detached document lookup and a
Nova-only mixed-component lifetime failure. Canonical-realm private document
lookup fixes the former. The next run passes 15/16 identity/lifetime cases and
all 6 queued async/deferred/module adoption cases; Nova still loses an ancestor
wrapper's expando after collection with only a foreign-created descendant held.
The pre-collection identity checks pass. This is an acceptance failure under
investigation, not a timing artifact or a permitted weakened identity contract.

The GC-policy rewrite now roots its starting inventory until every participant
realm has installed its component edges, then releases detached temporary roots
before collection. That closes an allocation-time collection window but did not
alone resolve Nova's observed failure. Parser deferred queues now retain node
IDs, and pending async/deferred execution skips nodes transferred out of the
preparation arena. Same-arena adoption into another inert document still needs
an explicit native node-document identity seam; physical membership alone does
not establish that case. Logs retain each failed build/run and its successor.


**Further verification, 2026-09-10:** the storage suite also passes all 68 tests
in release. The native Vano GC unit and integration gates pass; a new native
Symbol/WeakMap regression additionally proves retention through a late-marked
key and release after its strong root is removed. The collector resolves pending
ephemerons after all strong queues in each marking pass. The regression is
constructed to expose the previous queue ordering; an old-order negative binary
was not built. The final Nova realm suite passes all 19 tests, including the
retained-callable and cross-realm ephemeron cases.

A separate integration defect was found in GC-policy arguments: evaluating a
bare quoted string as a script can produce an undefined completion for a directive
prologue on Nova. Policy operation and payload strings now use parenthesized
expressions, and unknown private hook operations throw. The retained-callable
fixture used the same bare-string form and was corrected with a value assertion.
The full runtime/document rerun is still required to establish that the remaining
mixed-component lifetime failure is closed; the collector change alone is not
claimed as its demonstrated cause.

Capture recording now rejects an unrepresentable imported identity or an exported
node requiring current-value readback before consuming the journal or writing a
batch. Historical removal records remain representable. The new recorder tests
are included in the pending full scripted gate. Capture identity translation and
general filesystem write-failure atomicity remain outside this change.

**Contract handoff and corrected core gate, 2026-09-10:** the first full core
batch passed 49 document, 495 layout, 114 scripted and 482 runtime tests; five
runtime tests failed. The layout suite retained six pre-existing ignored tests.
All original cross-arena adoption cases passed, including Nova mixed-component
retention and release. Two soak fixtures incorrectly appended two document
roots; they now use one container without weakening their lifetime bounds.
Two policy-cost tests exceeded the unchanged 50 ms bound. The policy now avoids
re-rooting already persistent roots and borrows the sole store once for its
single-realm classification path. Both focused cost gates pass. The fifth
failure exposed a Range index retaining resolved weak targets strongly; the
index now retains weak entries and resolves targets only in temporary results.
The focused snapshot reclamation test passes, and a full corrected core rerun
is in progress. A new two-engine Range release regression accompanies the fix.

Every collection policy tick visits MAIN_REALM and all registered child hosts.
All realm policies are installed before temporary roots are released; death
inventories retire pins at current physical owners before stores collect.
Creation-realm locality is therefore not a sufficient native storage contract
for adopted nodes. A follow-on should make current-store access and explicit
owner-resolved access distinct, while preserving canonical wrapper creation.
The page-level Boa WeakRef versus native reclamation report needs its own job-
boundary regression; accounting-only lifetime tests do not settle it.

The earlier 44-unexpected DOM guard is historical evidence, not this slice's
result. A fresh runner and canonical guards are still required; lost passes
must not be repinned away. Required local Boa/Vano patches must be published on
the consumed branches with reproducible dependency revisions before a clean-
clone acceptance claim. Local source archives do not satisfy that condition.
This working-tree slice makes no commit and does not close broader G5, context
navigation/removal, associated-tree transfer or capture identity translation.

**Page weak reachability, 2026-09-10:** all four focused local/adopted page
WeakRef regressions pass on Boa and Nova (`page-weakref-3.log`). They check page
weak survivors against original wrapper identity and current native liveness,
and eventual reclamation after actual Promise-job checkpoints. The previously
reported Boa stale-wrapper behavior did not reproduce. An initial Nova failure
was an invalid fixture assumption: its host evaluation return ends the job and
clears kept objects. The corrected fixture keeps within-job checks in one
script evaluation and explicitly roots a successful weak result across later
host checks. This receipt does not close every host lifecycle boundary.

**Second corrected gate and fixture reconciliation, 2026-09-10:** the full core
rerun recovered both touched-node soaks and snapshot reclamation. Its runtime
unit suite passed 142/143, with Nova reparent-plus-policy cost at 72.6 ms
against the unchanged 50 ms ceiling (quiet policy 11.6 ms). The second bounded
optimization reuses captured inventory and skips duplicate connected rooting
only in the single-realm path. Multi-realm refresh/rooting remains intact for
wrappers minted by preceding hooks. Cleanup borrows root sets, releasing only
the original inventory after every hook returns. The next focused cost gate
passes: Boa quiet 7.9 ms/reparent 25.2 ms; Nova quiet 8.0 ms/reparent 44.8 ms.
That gate overlapped release compilation.

The new mutated-Range case initially failed on Boa because it never completed
a JavaScript job after WeakRef resolution. It now runs an actual Promise job
before reclamation checks. This fixture correction preserves the Range-index
strong-reference leak fix. A revised runtime suite is running.

A separate fixtures-only merge moved main to `8ad0c6b6d1a` before this core
rerun; this lane made no commit. Its ignored fixtures were reviewed: 18 ordinary
cases are now enabled, correcting connected-removal Range assertions,
source-captured custom-element owner comparisons, and detached-component GC
checks. Two live-iframe relocation cases remain ignored with the explicit
browsing-context ownership boundary; two negative controls remain enabled.
Final manifests record the actual base and working files; earlier receipts
retain their historical bases.

**Runtime acceptance and WPT regression repair, 2026-09-10:** the revised
runtime gate passes 513 tests, with only two live-iframe relocation fixtures
ignored. The focused page WeakRef and Range-release cases also pass. The first
fresh runner (SHA25613c8df89016192cad69fd0965ca6bbddcd389d20f1f9066f089fb39b39f4ede6)
reports both reftest guards at zero unexpected and the DOM testharness guard at
56 unexpected files. This is a mix of gains and losses, not an acceptance claim.
Named comparisons found three null-argument type-error regressions and two
Document-clone regressions introduced by stricter insertion validation. The
argument fix validates conversion before hierarchy; its 48 active targeted
tests pass. Document cloning now starts empty and assigns recursive ownership
to the cloned document; its two-engine regressions are queued in release.
Full named-result comparison and corrected-runner guards remain pending.

Other focused limitations are distinguished in the receipt WPT_NOTES.md:
inherited asynchronous custom-element reaction delivery fails synchronous
CEReactions expectations even within one document; iframe refusal includes
fresh iframe admission as well as live-context relocation; popup support and
template-associated/partial-update APIs remain open. None of these failures
is repinned away by this lane.

A separate disk-reclamation task removed both target dependency caches while
the follow-up scripted GC build ran. The user confirmed that cleanup cause.
Sources, completed passing gate receipts and the archived runner remain intact.
The release cache is rebuilding; remaining targeted tests use release artifacts.

**Remaining WPT losses and routing cost, 2026-09-10:** Document cloning and
argument/ancestor/reference validation order are repaired; the final focused
release tests pass on both engines. Named WPT comparison confirms that
appendChild preserves all prior passes and gains five (11/11), and insertBefore
preserves all prior passes and gains fourteen (26/40). The source keeps defensive
argument checks after authored getters and validates before detachment.

The Range replaceData file still exceeded the canonical 30-second limit with
builds finished, while a separate 120-second diagnostic passed all 1,146
assertions. This is an unresolved timing gate, not 1,146 assertion failures.
Owner lookup now records creation arenas when a realm registers and avoids
copying/repopulating the registry on every native read. Physical membership and
registered-host identity guard the local fast path; a slow refresh handles public
host DOM replacement without reassigning an imported node's creation realm.
A new unit regression covers that replacement. Full runtime and unchanged-policy
WPT validation of this optimization remain in progress.

**Publication, 2026-09-10:** after the user authorized commits and pushes, the
required fork changes landed as Boa `5a58112579cecaba6ba59d3310901992003fbb31`
on `origin/genet` and Vano `abfe3e4641de01f0f0a2b99667fd7397b262cb8f` on
`origin/main`. Both engine manifests now use those immutable revisions.
An isolated Cargo graph outside local path overrides resolved boa_engine,
boa_gc and nova_vm to those exact Git sources; metadata and its generated lock
are retained in the runtime receipt. The graph was seeded with the workspace's
known registry versions after an unconstrained resolver search was stopped.
This proves published dependency selection, not a full fresh-clone build.
The full release runtime rerun passes 518 tests, zero failed, two live-iframe
fixtures ignored. Clippy also passes with its recorded warnings.

The rebuilt runner `62f294050e0e30fc894ad95f01b1208580af5eb15d4b97135d20640b76140e0c`
passes the quiet replaceData gate at the unchanged 30-second worker limit,
with all 1,146 subtests passing. Whole-command wall time is 31.0 seconds,
including runner startup/reporting; this is not a changed worker deadline.
The full named baseline sweep is running with the same default policy.

**Full DOM named census, final runner:** 203 checked-baseline subtests improve
to pass. One prior pass remains lost: `Node-isConnected.html`,
`Test with iframes`, already failing in the earlier realms-continuation receipt.
Every former ordinary insertion/clone loss is restored. Range replaceData passes
all 1,146 assertions in the full default-policy run as well as in isolation.
The broad DOM guard still reports 59 unexpected files because its checked
expectations also differ on gains and nonpassing statuses. It is not green, and
the iframe pass is not repinned away. Against the historical longer-timeout
realms-post map, the only lost names are in Range dataChange (2,328); the checked
30-second baseline already marks that file hang-killed, so those cross-policy
counts do not describe a new adoption assertion regression. Remaining canonical
subsets are still running.

## Ordinary adoption lane: final verification and handoff, 2026-09-10

The bounded ordinary-subtree implementation is ready for publication. It
preserves canonical creation-realm identity while moving physical ownership,
with same-origin checks, complete preflight before detach, Range/observer
participation, script preparation and owner-store collection. It does not
accept associated template/shadow or browsing-context-bearing subtree transfer.

- Release script-runtime-api: 518 passed, zero failed, two live-iframe fixtures
  ignored. Both engines are covered; counts are combined, not per engine.
- Release scripted GC follow-up: two passed; runtime Clippy and release runner
  build completed successfully. Earlier document/layout/store/engine gates and
  corrected failed attempts remain in the receipt with their source boundaries.
- Final runner: `62f294050e0e30fc894ad95f01b1208580af5eb15d4b97135d20640b76140e0c`.
  Range replaceData passes 1,146/1,146 both alone at the unchanged 30-second
  worker limit and inside the full DOM sweep.
- All 14 canonical testharness subsets were evaluated using the standard
  defaults. The receipt wrapper adds named-result output and continues after
  failures; it does not change policy or repository expectations. Twelve
  subsets report zero unexpected. Broad DOM reports 59 unexpected files and
  DOM/nodes reports 35. These overlapping guards include gains/status changes
  and the same single lost pass, `Node-isConnected.html: Test with iframes`.
  That loss already existed in the prior realms continuation and remains
  protected. The DOM census gains 203 named passes, with every introduced
  ordinary insertion/clone regression restored.
- Both reftest guards report zero unexpected. Focused WPT fixtures on both
  engines retain the documented synchronous CEReactions, iframe/popup and
  template/partial-update boundaries; passing local approximations are not
  substituted for those exact fixtures.

The three earlier realms expectation repins preserve every prior pass and are
distinct from this adoption verification. No adoption loss was repinned away.
The ownership audit covers 55 continuation paths plus the two immutable engine
manifests. Boa `5a58112579cecaba6ba59d3310901992003fbb31` and Vano
`abfe3e4641de01f0f0a2b99667fd7397b262cb8f` are published; isolated Cargo
resolution selects those exact revisions without local overrides, and all 25
changed fork source/test files match the fetched copies modulo line endings.
This is dependency-selection proof, not a full fresh-clone build receipt.

The next owner can take broader G5 context/associated-state transfer and the
owner-resolved accessor refinement separately. Opaque rooting already iterates
every registered realm at each tick. Capture now refuses unsupported imported
identities before consuming the mutation journal; replay translation remains
open. Four page WeakRef regressions passed, without reproducing the reported
Boa stale-wrapper case. Full headed G5 and frame teardown/navigation remain
unaccepted. Final source/runner archives, publication identities and cache
release status are under `testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-09-09_dom-adoption-runtime`
in the shared Code workspace.

## Phase: owner-resolved accessor and imported-identity replay, 2026-09-10

**Genet commit at phase start:** `741bf726eb4`
(`741bf726eb42283a11961d24dd0da14cb08d0f5b`), clean tree. This phase makes no
commit. Receipts: `testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-09-10_accessor_replay` in the
shared Code workspace.

The ordinary-adoption handoff left two items: "the owner-resolved accessor
refinement", and "capture now refuses unsupported imported identities before
consuming the mutation journal; replay translation remains open". Both are the
same fact seen twice. Adoption made a node's **creation realm** and its
**owning store** independent, and two places still assumed they were one: a
native sink that decoded an agent-wide reflector and then read "the current
document", and a capture record that carried a bare serial with no arena.

### 1. Owner-resolved accessor

The engine contract gains `CallCx::local_reflector_data`, replacing
`reflector_is_local`. It returns the reflector's data **only** when the
reflector was minted in the callback's current realm, so the locality test and
the decode cannot be separated — the previous pair invited "decode now, check
the arena later", and its own doc line said so. Its doc names what it answers
for: the realm `current_realm` reports, and that realm's host arena. Boa reads
the immutable `Reflector { owner, data }` provenance in one downcast; Nova
reads `EmbedderObject`'s owner and embedder data in one match; neither consults
a raw id or a public prototype, so neither is forgeable from script.
Single-realm backends keep the trait default, which is exactly `reflector_data`
— true there, since one realm has one arena.

`CallCx::reflector_data` stays agent-wide and unchanged. It says *which node*,
never *which arena may dereference it*.

Above it, `script-runtime-api` replaces the old `LocalReflectorCx` helper with
`OwnerResolvedCx::owned_node`, which resolves a reflector to an `OwnedNode`:
the host that **physically owns** the node, plus the `NodeId` that host's arena
stores it under. `OwnedNode::with_dom` / `with_host` are the only way to
dereference it, so the arena is not a separate choice a sink can get wrong. The
arena-local case is answered by the engine accessor; a same-origin reflector
from another realm is a deliberate cross-arena read and falls through to
`reflector_data`, resolved to *its* owner rather than read in this one. A dead
node or a cross-origin owner still throws exactly the errors it did before —
`validate` is now that resolution with the result dropped, so there is one
implementation of the rule instead of two.

`require_same_owner` follows: the operands arrive already resolved, so it
compares the stores they resolved to (`Rc::ptr_eq`) instead of resolving each
one a second time.

**Counts.** Before: **60 native sinks**, across 72 call sites in eight files,
took a bare `ReflectorData` from the agent-wide accessor and then dereferenced
it — safety by convention at every one. After: **0**. All 60 go through
`owned_node`, at 71 call sites (two reference-node decodes merged, one added).
The wide `reflector_data` remains at **7 call sites in three files**, all of
them intended cross-arena reads: `dom/adoption.rs` (`host_for_call`, the
`wrap`/`ownerDocument` hook, `prepareScripts`, `moGroup`, `transfer`),
`dom/tree.rs` (`NodeRealmState`, the foreign/local report the bootstrap refuses
adoption with), and the fallback inside `owned_node` itself. Structured clone,
event retargeting and messaging decode no `NodeId` natively — they run through
the bootstrap — so they needed no site here.

The one sink that must *not* be owner-resolved is `stream_target`
(`document.write` and friends): a stream belongs to the callback realm's own
arena, so it resolves and then additionally requires local physical membership,
refusing a same-origin foreign document rather than writing into it.

### 2. Imported-identity capture and replay

`genet-scripted-dom` gains `CapturedNodeId { arena, serial }` — an identity, as
against a serial, which is not one. Once adoption moves nodes with their
identity intact, two arenas can hold the same serial, so a journal carrying
only the serial replays onto whichever node the replaying arena happens to have
allocated at that index. That is the consumer audit's finding 2, and it is
worse than the panic in finding 1 because it is silent.

`ScriptedDom` now keeps an **import registry**: the set of arenas it has
imported nodes from, written by `transfer_detached_subtree_to` as part of the
transfer it already performs. `try_capture_node_identity` records the origin
arena instead of refusing a foreign one it can account for;
`try_remint_node_identity` translates a local origin through the existing
serial check, translates a registered imported origin by packing the identity
and checking physical membership, and refuses an unregistered origin with the
new `NodeIdentityError::UnknownOriginArena` rather than reminting.

`genet-scripted`'s `RecordedMutation` carries `CapturedNodeId` in every node
field, and gains `replay_node` / `replay_ids`, which translate through the
registry and return the typed `ReplayError::UnknownOrigin` / `Unresolvable`.
Every identity in a record resolves before a replayer touches the document, so
one unknown origin refuses the record rather than half-applying it. The
fallible path is the only path in `capture.rs`, including its tests, which
previously asserted against the panicking `capture_node_id`.

The wire format changed rather than gaining a version shim, per the doc
policy's §3. The retired `layout` field stays as it was.

**What stopped refusing, deliberately.** The old
`recorder_refuses_imported_batch_without_consuming_live_mutations` asserted the
placeholder: an adopted node's first destination mutation refused the whole
batch. That is now the supported case, and the test became
`recorder_records_an_adopted_node_and_replay_resolves_the_same_live_node`. The
exported-readback refusal, the historical-removal representability and the
identity-space refusals are unchanged.

### Named regression manifest

| Regression | Where |
|---|---|
| `reflector_locality_uses_owner_not_raw_id` (Boa and Nova) | `script-engine-boa/lib.rs`, `script-engine-nova/tests/realms.rs` — now driving `local_reflector_data`; canonical and uncached equal raw ids, prototype changes, non-reflectors, forced GC |
| `owner_resolved_native_reads` (Boa and Nova) | `script-runtime-api/tests/cross_arena_adoption.rs` — after adoption, the attribute, `textContent` and `innerHTML` sinks reached from the creation realm all write the owning arena, and the creation arena no longer holds the node |
| `recorder_records_an_adopted_node_and_replay_resolves_the_same_live_node` | `genet-scripted/capture.rs` — the record names the origin arena, and every identity in it replays to the live imported node |
| `replay_refuses_a_serial_from_an_unregistered_arena` | `genet-scripted/capture.rs` — two stores whose serials collide; replay refuses with `UnknownOrigin` instead of resolving the decoy, and the same record still replays in its own arena |
| `adopted_node_capture_replays_to_the_same_live_node` (Boa and Nova) | `genet-scripted/document.rs` — a child-realm `<p>` adopted into the parent document, mutated there, recorded and replayed to the same live node through a real two-realm document |
| `recorder_refuses_exported_readback_without_consuming_source_journal` | `genet-scripted/capture.rs` — retained unchanged |

### Gates

Runner SHA-256s: `pre`
`81e63419d128b501e5ed71e278fbd5c956cbaf6a2c0708b530e5bf1e5c886ec0`, built from
`741bf726eb4` **before the first edit**; `post`
`60f5600817c9f900f174dea601dec89356d7fd98e7d704bf094513cb720f1a24`.
`Cargo.lock` is git-ignored here, so both digests are recorded in the receipt;
the whole difference between them is one added `serde` edge on
`genet-scripted-dom`, with no revision movement — which is what makes the null
census below readable rather than two effects cancelling.

Census, disk mode, `--engine boa --renderer livery --jobs 8 --timeout 240`:

| Subset | Files | Subtests passed (pre → post) | File moves | Subtest moves |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dom` | 698 | 46,593 → 46,593 | 0 | 0 |
| `html/semantics/embedded-content/the-iframe-element` | 164 | 23 → 23 | 0 | 0 |
| `shadow-dom` | 314 | 1,522 → 1,522 | 0 | 0 |
| `webmessaging` | 160 | 169 → 169 | 0 | 0 |

Zero pass-to-fail movements, so nothing needed explaining or fixing. Twelve of
the fourteen canonical testharness slices report `unexpected=0`; broad `dom`
reports 59 and `dom/nodes` 35, the same counts the ordinary-adoption lane
recorded, and the census shows this phase moved neither. `dom` and `dom/nodes`
were not repinned, and the protected loss `Node-isConnected.html: Test with
iframes` was not touched. Both reftest guards report `unexpected=0`. Both Ortet
receipts are unchanged — `article` `0x6377ba8a6bf4dbc9` and `frames`
`0x97bdd4bd9e03ec02`, three consecutive matching captures each.

Native: the release `script-runtime-api` suite passes **520 tests, zero failed,
two ignored** (the two live-iframe relocation fixtures, which belong to the next
lane) — 518 before this phase plus its two accessor regressions. The debug suite
matches. `genet-scripted` with `scripted-nova` passes 115 library and 2
integration tests; `genet-scripted-dom`, both engine adapters and the engine API
pass. Clippy on all six touched crates with `--all-targets` exits clean
(warnings retained in the log), rustfmt is clean on every touched file, and
`cargo check --workspace --features genet-wpt/netfetch` passes.

### What this phase does not do

It does not widen the adoption boundary: associated template/shadow trees and
browsing-context-bearing subtrees still refuse. It does not implement a capture
*replayer* — it implements the identity translation a replayer needs, and proves
it against real records. It does not touch full G5, headed acceptance, or frame
teardown and navigation.

## Phase: browsing-context lifecycle, 2026-09-10

**Genet commit at phase start:** `1fbd90c6043`
(`1fbd90c6043784e90f9a85bf9b967ff42224e591`), clean tree. This phase makes no
commit. Receipts: `testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-09-10_iframe_lifecycle` in the
shared Code workspace.

The realms handoff left four items under one heading: live iframe relocation,
browsing-context relocation, navigation with a stable `WindowProxy`, and
removed-frame lifecycle cleanup. Three of them turn out to be one mechanism.
The fourth does not, and is left open below with its cost named rather than
approximated.

The mechanism is HTML's iframe removing steps. A nested browsing context is
destroyed when its element leaves a connected tree and a *fresh* one is created
when it is inserted again — so `appendChild` of a live iframe elsewhere, and
`adoptNode` across documents, are destroy-then-create, not a move. Once removal
destroys the context, a relocated iframe reaches cross-arena adoption as an
ordinary subtree, and the ordinary-adoption lane already handles it. The
relocation item and the teardown item are the same edit seen from two ends.

### 1. Teardown, in two halves

`FrameState` gains `detach_subtree` and a `pending_teardown` queue, and the two
halves are split exactly where HTML splits "destroy a child navigable":

- **Synchronously**, on removal, the container stops having a content navigable.
  The records and contexts for the realm and every realm nested beneath it are
  dropped, so `contentWindow`, `window.length`, the indexed `window[i]`
  accessors and the adoption preflight all stop seeing it in the same tick the
  element left the tree.
- **In a queued task**, each detached document is unloaded and released. HTML is
  explicit that the removing steps run no script, and
  `dom/nodes/insertion-removing-steps/insertion-removing-steps-iframe.window.html`
  checks it three ways; a first implementation dispatched `unload` inline and
  that census caught it as three named regressions.

The queued half fires `pagehide` then `unload` in each document, ancestor before
descendant, then releases child-first: the realm's timers and animation
callbacks are cancelled, its host registration, opaque-root bookkeeping,
adoption-registry entry and pending fetch routes are removed, its browsing
context is discarded from the tree, and the realm itself is discarded through
the engine contract.

Cancelling the tasks needs the agent's private timer queue, which is
deliberately not reachable from any global. `AgentState` retains a
`cancel_realm_tasks` closure the same way and for the same reason it already
retains `timer_state`.

### 2. The engine contract gains a from-call discard

`ScriptEngine::discard_realm_from_call` is the teardown counterpart to
`create_realm_from_call`. The existing `discard_realm` is an outer entry, and
the removal that triggers a teardown is a native callback; Nova's version in
particular cannot reach the outer `run_in_realm` from inside the agent. Both
implementations refuse `MAIN_REALM` and the callback's own current realm — a
realm cannot free the frame it is executing in — and both are one operation:
Boa drops the registry's `Gc<Realm>` handle, Nova additionally takes the
`Global` root. Single-realm backends keep the `Unsupported` default.

### 3. What the adoption refusal now asks

`dom/adoption.rs` refused `iframe | object | embed | canvas` by element name.
`object`, `embed` and `canvas` still own host state with no ownership
transaction and are still refused. `iframe` is refused by *fact* instead — and
the two transfer passes ask the question differently, which is the whole
correction:

- The **preflight** runs before the removal steps, so any context it sees is one
  the very next step destroys. Reading it as an obstacle refuses every live
  relocation, which is what the two ignored fixtures were ignored for.
- The **mutating** pass runs after them, so a context still live at that point
  belongs to an element the mutation funnel never saw, and moving it would
  strand the context's realm. That is still refused.

`moveBefore` is the exception HTML carves out and the one mutation with no
discard: its regression asserts the same realm, and the same window object the
parent already held, on the far side of the move.

### 4. The frame's parent is its container's realm

Finding, and the reason the relocation fixtures still failed after the teardown
landed. `__frameWindow` derived the nested context's parent from
`cx.current_realm()` and checked liveness against that realm's host. Adoption
already made three things independent — the realm a script runs in, the realm a
reflector was minted in, and the realm whose document physically holds the node —
and relocating a live iframe separates all three at once. HTML parents a nested
context in its *container document's* browsing context, so `OwnedNode` now
carries `owner_realm()` and `__frameWindow` uses it for both.

This also retires a refusal that was a limitation rather than a rule:
`owner_native_boundaries.rs` asserted that a `contentWindow` getter borrowed
across realms *threw*. It no longer does — a same-origin cross-arena read is
legal, and the test now asserts the stronger fact, that the context it returns
is parented in the container, not in the caller. The borrowed `document.open` /
`write` / `close` refusal is unchanged: a stream belongs to the callback realm's
own arena.

### 5. What a discarded context reports, and what WPT says about it

The handoff's premise was that a parent holding `contentWindow` afterwards sees
`closed` true and `document` null. Half of that is wrong, and the census is
where it was caught.
`html/browsers/the-window-object/document-attribute.window.js` asserts that a
removed frame's window keeps answering with the *same* document immediately
after `remove()` and again a hundred milliseconds later. A Window's `document`
is its document; it is the WindowProxy's `[[Window]]` that a discard replaces,
and this stack hands out the Window. So `closed` flips — `Window.closed` did not
exist at all before this phase — and `document` deliberately does not. The
first implementation nulled it and lost two named passes for the trouble.

### 6. Navigation with a stable WindowProxy: not implemented, and why

This item is not approximated here, and the plan should not read as though it
were. There is no navigation in this stack at all: `location.href =`,
`location.assign`, `location.replace` and `history.pushState` / `go` update
`HostState.base_url` and nothing else — no unload, no new realm, no document
load, no `load` event on the container, no `popstate`. Building it means writing
HTML's navigate algorithm, and the identity half of the requirement means
introducing a real `WindowProxy` indirection.

**This is a decision for Mark, not a gap to fill quietly**, because the proxy
changes object identity across the whole stack. Today `contentWindow` returns
the child's actual global. A WindowProxy that survives navigation cannot be that
object, so `frame.contentWindow === childWindow` only stays true if the child's
own `window`, `self`, `frames`, `parent` and `top` return the proxy too — and
`globalThis` still cannot, because no engine here can make it. The choice is
between a documented `globalThis !== window` deviation inside child realms and
some larger engine-level change, and it wants a ruling before code. The bounded
items above are landed and verified without it.

### Named regression manifest

| Regression | Where |
|---|---|
| `wpt_window_length_nested_context` (Boa and Nova) | `script-runtime-api/tests/cross_arena_adoption_fixtures.rs` — the two previously ignored live-iframe fixtures, un-ignored: a nested iframe relocated from a child document into the parent, `window.length` counting both, and the relocated context's `top` being the new document's window |
| `teardown_releases_everything` (Boa and Nova) | `script-runtime-api/tests/frame_lifecycle.rs` — three attach/remove cycles over a child and its grandchild: no script runs synchronously, the container has no content navigable in the same tick, `pagehide`/`unload` arrive ancestor-first in the queued task, a cancelled timer never fires, `closed` is true and `document` unchanged, every host registration and realm is released, no realm id is reused, and the parent arena returns to its baseline node count after a collection tick |
| `move_before_preserves_context` (Boa and Nova) | `script-runtime-api/tests/frame_lifecycle.rs` — `moveBefore` keeps the realm and the window object the parent already held |
| `discard_realm_from_call_refuses_main_and_self_and_releases_the_target` | `script-engine-boa/lib.rs` and `script-engine-nova/tests/realms.rs` — the new contract method on both backends: both refusals, the release, and the agent left intact |
| `borrowed_document_stream` (Boa and Nova) | `script-runtime-api/tests/owner_native_boundaries.rs` — retargeted: the stream still refuses, the borrowed `contentWindow` resolves to its container |
| `atomic_refusal` (Boa and Nova) | `script-runtime-api/tests/cross_arena_replacement.rs` — retargeted from `iframe` to `object`; the subject was always the atomicity of a refusal, and `iframe` stopped being one |

### Census

Disk mode, `--engine boa --renderer livery --jobs 8 --timeout 240`. Pre runner
`1ee89f43a2b45a6572102ceaa898a6d63c013fcf315dafbc737090b0b681cef9`, built from
`1fbd90c6043` **before the first edit**; post runner
`467556c18da52219ecab6ccb720c287b4f0218c9ba3425e50c20db4574796c88`. `Cargo.lock`
is `eeb325f180bdcc9cb49c23322b0bac144cbfc84021ef269f142d4977760199b2` and
unchanged — this phase adds no dependency, so nothing in the census is two
effects cancelling.

| Subset | Files | Subtests passed (pre → post) | File moves | Subtest moves |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `dom` | 698 | 46,593 → 46,594 | +1 / −0 | +1 / −0 |
| `html/dom` | 387 | 42,377 → 42,377 | 0 | 0 |

| `webmessaging` | 160 | 169 → 171 | +1 / −0 | +2 / −0 |

Total +8 named subtest passes and +8 files reaching all-pass, with **zero
pass-to-fail movements**, so nothing needed explaining away. Every gain is on
the lane:

| Newly passing | What it is |
|---|---|
| `the-iframe-element/move_iframe_in_dom_01..04.html` | the four canonical "moving a modified IFRAME in the document" files, all four, across `about:blank` and served originals and across DOM and `document.write` modification |
| `windows/nested-browsing-contexts/window-top.html`, "Two nested iframes" | the container-realm parentage correction |
| `dom/abort/abort-signal-timeout.html`, "not aborted after frame detach" | teardown |
| `webmessaging/broadcastchannel/detached-iframe.html`, both subtests | detached-frame lifecycle |

Three named regressions were found by an interim census and fixed rather than
recorded: the three `insertion-removing-steps-iframe` subtests, from dispatching
`unload` synchronously, and `document-attribute.window.html`, from nulling a
discarded context's document. The final census carries none of them.

### Repins, and the one that is not made

One forward-only repin, three lines:
`ports/genet-wpt/expectations/testharness/dom_abort_boa.json`, only
`dom/abort/abort-signal-timeout.html`, fail 0/1 to pass 1/1. Membership is
unchanged at 13 files and no former pass moves; the subset re-checks at
`unexpected=0` afterwards.

`dom_boa.json` and `dom_nodes_boa.json` are **not** repinned, and both guards
stay red, because the protected loss is not recovered:

> `dom/nodes/Node-isConnected.html`, "Test with iframes" — still failing.

Its cause is now precise, and it is not this lane's. The test appends an iframe
into another frame's `contentDocument` from a `<script>` that runs **while the
main document is still parsing**, and `ScriptedDom::preflight_subtree_transfer_to`
refuses any cross-arena transfer whose source store has `parsing` set, with
`PendingSourceWork`. A two-subtest probe run on the post runner isolates it: the
identical adoption refuses during parsing and succeeds from a `step_timeout`
after it, in the same file, in the same run — the positive control and the
negative in one measurement. The equivalent fixture in
`cross_arena_adoption_fixtures.rs` passes on both engines for the same reason.
Lifting that guard means deciding whether a transferred subtree can intersect
the parser's stack of open elements, which belongs to the parser/adoption lane.

`dom_boa` reports 60 unexpected against the 59 it inherited; the one added is
the `abort-signal-timeout` **gain**, the same one the repin above records for
`dom/abort`. `dom_nodes_boa` is unchanged at 35. Neither guard's redness moved
in the wrong direction, and no adoption loss was repinned away.

### Gates

### What this phase does not do

It does not implement navigation, and therefore neither the stable `WindowProxy`
nor `load` per navigation nor session-history traversal in a child; see §6, which
records that as a decision rather than a task. It does not lift the parsing-time
adoption refusal. It does not widen the adoption boundary for `object`, `embed`
or `canvas`, or for associated template and shadow trees. It does not touch full
G5 or headed acceptance.

## Phase: WindowProxy and navigation, 2026-09-11

The `WindowProxy` the previous phase declined to build, and the navigation
algorithm it was waiting on. Genet commit at phase start and end:
`a0b1b4f20eb` — nothing is committed; the whole phase is the working tree,
banked as `testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-09-10_windowproxy_navigation/genet-working-tree.patch`.

Forks, both unchanged by this phase and both needing a push before any of this
can be committed:

| Fork | Path | Branch | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Boa | `crates/boa` | `genet-windowproxy` | `52cfb6ff9efdaf0ff6d213ab107bbaefe5838ab0 (tip; 091d5543 plus two test-and-format commits the fork's pre-push CI required)` |
| Vano | `crates/vano` | `genet-windowproxy` | `3101fb63` |

### The design, as Mark ruled it

Three questions were open at the end of §6 of the lifecycle phase. All three
are answered, and all three are implemented as answered.

#### A. One WindowProxy per context; the cross-origin decision lives inside it

There is no second object for a cross-origin window. HTML's own shape is one
`WindowProxy` per browsing context that answers *differently depending on who is
asking*, and it has to be: `frame.contentWindow === frame.contentWindow` must
hold across a navigation that changes the frame's origin, so the object cannot
be swapped for a façade when the origin changes. The old per-viewer façade,
`__makeCrossOriginWindow`, is deleted; `view_from` now returns the context's one
proxy whoever is looking, and `viewer` stops being a parameter of *which*
object and becomes only a parameter of what it will say.

Who is asking is captured where it is available and nowhere else. The eleven
native trap getters live in genet's adapters, not in the forks, and each one
stamps the accessing realm on the proxy's shadow before handing the trap over
(`WINDOW_PROXY_ACCESS_SLOT`). One correction to the design as stated: a Proxy's
internal methods do not switch realms, but **calling a native function does** —
the getter is a builtin of the realm the proxy was built in, so the accessing
realm is `native_caller_realm()`, not `current_realm()`. Both adapters read the
caller and fall back to the current realm. The first cut read the current realm
and every cross-origin access was admitted; `cross_arena_adoption.rs`'s
opaque-origin fixture caught it.

Nothing runs between the getter and the trap call, so a single slot is enough
and the handler reads it first.

The JavaScript handler then decides, through the browsing-context tree, by
calling the host hook the runtime hands it (`__windowProxyHost`), whose six
operations are `sameOrigin`, `denied`, `property`, `named`, `post` and
`navigate`. `denied` builds the `SecurityError` with the **accessing** realm's
intrinsics, so `instanceof DOMException` holds on the side that catches it. The
hook is a native of the realm currently behind the proxy and is replaced on
every navigation, so it never outlives its realm.

`CrossOriginProperties(W)` is the full thirteen — `window`, `self`, `location`,
`close`, `closed`, `focus`, `blur`, `frames`, `length`, `top`, `opener`,
`parent`, `postMessage` — plus indexed and named child contexts. Everything
else is a `SecurityError`, with HTML's four-key fallback (`then` and the three
well-known symbols) answering `undefined` so a cross-origin window is not
thenable and does not break `Object.prototype.toString`. `[[OwnPropertyKeys]]`
reports indexes, then the thirteen, then `then` and the three symbols;
`[[GetPrototypeOf]]` is null; `[[SetPrototypeOf]]` is SetImmutablePrototype;
`[[PreventExtensions]]` returns false. The cross-origin `Location` exposes
`href` as a setter with no getter, and `replace`, and both navigate for real.
Methods and the `Location` are cached per accessing realm — HTML's
`CrossOriginPropertyDescriptorMap` — so `w.close === w.close` holds.

#### B. Navigation replaces the realm at every level — with one honest exception

A child navigation is: unload, new realm, new `Document`, proxy rebind,
interleaved parse, `load` on the parent's iframe. That is implemented and
measured.

The host policy hook exists and is the only thing that makes a top-level
navigation different: `Runtime::set_top_level_navigation_policy`, default allow,
asked before a top-level navigation proceeds and never asked about a child.

**The top-level realm is not replaced, and this phase could not make it so.**
`MAIN_REALM` is not merely a realm id in this stack: `discard_realm_from_call`
refuses it by contract, `hosts[&MAIN_REALM]` is the agent's root host,
`view(MAIN_REALM)` is what `top` resolves to, `pending_main_load` keys the
document-complete barrier to it, and — decisively — `Runtime::eval`,
`Runtime::host`, `Runtime::parse_document_interleaved` and every embedder that
uses them resolve against it. Replacing it means every one of those follows a
*current top realm* that moves, which is a change to the `Runtime` API surface
and to Ortet, `genet-scripted`, `genet-documents` and the WPT runner. That is
not a change this lane can make behind the API, and it is not additive.

So a top-level navigation here moves the document URL and joins the session
history, and does not unload or replace the realm. The receipt is exactly that:
`navigate_top_level` in `components/script-runtime-api/frames.rs`, which asks
the policy hook and then does those two things. Retained size of the deviation:
one realm, the top one, per agent — the same realm the engine already refuses to
discard. Making it replaceable is its own lane, and it should be scoped as a
`Runtime` change, not as a navigation change.

#### C. The first realm is not retained — confirmed, on both engines

The proxy's `[[ProxyTarget]]` is no longer the realm's global object. It is a
small shadow object the adapter builds alongside the proxy (null prototype,
same realm) which holds only the mirrors a `Proxy`'s invariants demand; the
handler holds the current `[[Window]]` and forwards to it. The handler,
the shadow and the control function the bootstrap returns are the only things
that survive, and none of them is a global.

The receipt is in `tests/navigation.rs`: a child is navigated three times, and
after each one `runtime.host_in_realm(outgoing).is_err()` — the outgoing realm
is discarded — while the proxy the parent took *before the first navigation*
still answers with the new document. The first of those three outgoing realms is
the proxy's own home realm, the one holding the handler closure, the shadow and
the eleven native trap getters. **Both Boa and Nova keep all of it alive after
that realm is discarded**, so the fallback the ruling allowed for is not needed
and no realm is retained.

Two mechanisms make that work, and both are worth naming:

- The proxy is not reached through its home realm at all. The bootstrap
  publishes nothing on any global; its completion value is a control function
  (`'proxy'`, `'bind'`, `'window'`, `'host'`, `'descriptor'`) which the host
  roots in `FrameState::window_proxies` as `Rc<dyn Any>`. An
  `eval_in_realm(home, …)` would have failed the moment the home realm went.
- Ordering. `finish_global_this_initialization` closes its window on the first
  code that runs in the realm, so the sequence is: build the proxy over a fresh
  shadow (no code), publish the global object and the shadow on the global
  object as `__windowProxyGlobal` / `__windowProxyTarget` (no code), finish the
  global `this` (no code), *then* evaluate `window_proxy.js` — the only script
  that can see a proxy with no handler — and only then install the host surface.

One deviation this forces, recorded rather than hidden: HTML's
[LegacyUnforgeable] attributes — `window`, `document`, `top` — are defined on
the **Window**, through `__windowProxyGlobal`, rather than through the proxy. A
non-configurable property defined *through* a `Proxy` pins its descriptor on the
proxy's target for good, and these three have to outlive the navigations that
replace the Window behind them. The slot stays on the global object and every
trap hides it, so nothing reached through the WindowProxy can see it; an
unqualified reference in the realm's own script can, which is the price.

### What was built

1. **`components/script-runtime-api/window_proxy.js`** (new, 400 lines). The
   whole of WindowProxy's semantics: the same-origin forwarding handler with its
   invariant mirrors, and the cross-origin branch with its descriptor helper,
   key list, `Location` and per-realm caches.
2. **Adapters.** `new_window_proxy_in_realm` / `…_from_call` build the proxy
   over their own shadow and publish it; the eleven trap getters stamp the
   accessing realm. `finish_global_this_in_realm` / `…_from_call` unchanged from
   the first half.
3. **`frames.rs`.** `install_window_proxy_from_call` is now the single entry —
   a first document builds and binds, a navigation rebinds — and
   `adopt_window_view_from_call` is gone with it. `navigate_context`,
   `navigate_fragment`, `navigate_top_level`, `unload_for_navigation`,
   `perform_navigation`, `RunNavigations`, `Navigate`, `NavigateFrame`,
   `WindowProxyHost`, `window_property`, `named_child`, `with_context` and
   `navigate_from_call` are new.
4. **Session history over the browsing-context crate.** `pushState`,
   `replaceState`, `state`, `length`, `go`, `back`, `forward` and `popstate` all
   read and write `BrowsingContext::history_mut()`. The per-document list in
   `HostState` survives only as the fallback for a runtime that has no context
   tree at all, which is what every pre-context `history` test exercises.
5. **`browsing-context`.** `navigate_with(document, replace)`,
   `set_document_url`, `HistoryEntry::document` + `in_document`, and
   `BrowsingContext::document_serial`.

### Whether a traversal keeps the document

Worth stating on its own, because the first cut got it wrong and the navigation
fixture caught it. A traversal is same-document when the target entry belongs to
the document showing now — *not* when the URLs match modulo fragment.
`pushState` can move the URL anywhere inside one document, and two entries can
share a URL across a reload. `BrowsingContext` therefore counts its documents:
every real navigation advances `document_serial`, a fragment navigation and a
`pushState` do not, and every entry is stamped with the serial current when it
was made.

### Named regression manifest

Seven defects found by a fixture or by the census during this phase, and fixed
rather than recorded. Each is named by what found it.

| Defect | Found by |
|---|---|
| The trap getters read `current_realm()`, which is the proxy's realm, so every cross-origin access was admitted | `cross_arena_adoption.rs::opaque_frame_access_stays_refused` |
| `sameOrigin` returned a JS boolean and the handler compared it to the string `'true'`, so every context read as same-origin | the same fixture |
| A discarded context's origin comparison fell through the tree and answered "cross-origin", so a parent holding a destroyed child's proxy lost `document` | `frame_lifecycle.rs::teardown_releases_everything` |
| The cross-origin `postMessage` closure did not carry the accessing realm, so a message from a sandboxed child arrived with the parent's origin | `frame_realms.rs::sandbox_script_permission_and_origin_are_independent` |
| The cross-origin `Location` was cached under the key `location`, colliding with the cached descriptor of the `location` property, so `w.location` handed back a property descriptor | `frame_window_security.rs::descriptors_are_own_cached_and_restricted` |
| A traversal decided same-document by URL, so `history.back()` after `pushState` reloaded | `navigation.rs::push_state_and_traversal_fire_popstate` |
| `location.href = 'javascript:…'` performed a document navigation and fired `load` | the interim census, `iframe_navigate_javascript_url.htm` |

The last one is the only one the census found; the interim census carrying it
is not retained, and the banked `post` maps are all from the runner that has the
fix.

### Census

Nine subsets, 2153 files, `--engine boa --renderer livery --jobs 8
--timeout 240`, mapped under
`testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-09-10_windowproxy_navigation/`.

| Subset | Files | File gains | File regressions | Subtests before → after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dom` | 698 | 0 | 0 | 46594 → 46594 |
| `html/browsers/browsing-the-web` | 332 | 5 | 1 | 30 → 38 |
| `html/browsers/history` | 140 | 2 | 0 | 94 → 96 |
| `html/browsers/origin` | 116 | 0 | 0 | 12 → 13 |
| `html/browsers/the-window-object` | 96 | 0 | 0 | 83 → 86 |
| `html/browsers/windows` | 60 | 0 | 0 | 8 → 8 |
| `html/dom` | 387 | 0 | 0 | 42377 → 42377 |
| `html/semantics/embedded-content/the-iframe-element` | 164 | 5 | 0 | 27 → 32 |
| `webmessaging` | 160 | 0 | 0 | 171 → 171 |
| **Total** | **2153** | **12** | **1** | **+19** |

Twelve files move `fail → pass`, among them all four
`iframe-loading-lazy-nav-location-*` files, both `navigation-unload-*` files,
`joint-session-history-remove-iframe.html`, `location_assign_about_blank.html`,
both `scroll-to-fragid` files and
`javascript-url-security-check-failure.sub.html`. Three
`window-properties.https.html` `frames` subtests and the cross-origin
`function-name` subtest also flip.

Two pass-to-nonpass subtest movements, both **former vacuous passes** — under
the old tree neither `iframe.src = url` nor `location.assign(url)` navigated
anything, so the navigation-dependent half of each test never ran:

1. `history-traversal/pageswap/pageswap-iframe.html` — pass → no-results. The
   file is `explicit_done` and calls `done()` from the child's `onpagehide`,
   which now fires; the handler asserts on a `pageswap` event genet does not
   have, throws, and `done()` is never reached. Recovering it needs the
   Navigation API.
2. `initial-empty-document/iframe-src-aboutblank-navigate-immediately.html`,
   "Navigating to a different document with location.assign" — pass → fail. The
   helper's `waitForLoad` attaches a `{once: true}` load listener *after*
   requesting the navigation, and genet fires the **initial** `about:blank` load
   event from a queued task rather than synchronously during "process the iframe
   attributes"; the stale event wins the race. The identical sibling subtest
   "with src" already failed the same way in `pre`, which is the positive
   control: this is the initial-load ordering, not the navigation. The companion
   `iframe-src-aboutblank-wait-for-load.html`, which waits for that load first,
   **gains all three** of its navigation subtests.

**No repins.** Every gain is in `html/browsers/*` or
`html/semantics/embedded-content/the-iframe-element`, and no checked expectation
map covers those directories. The protected
`dom/nodes/Node-isConnected.html` "Test with iframes" loss stays pinned as a
failure, untouched.

**Lockfile delta: none.** `Cargo.lock` is byte-identical to the banked `pre`,
`eeb325f180bdcc9cb49c23322b0bac144cbfc84021ef269f142d4977760199b2`.

### The runtime receipt

`components/script-runtime-api/tests/navigation.rs`, ten cases, both engines.
The three-navigation case asserts, per pass: `held === frame.contentWindow` and
`held === frames[0]` for the proxy taken before the first navigation; the new
document behind it; a new realm id that was never used before; the outgoing
realm discarded; and afterwards the whole unload-and-load sequence in one
string, `one:pagehide,one:unload,load,two:pagehide,two:unload,load,three:pagehide,three:unload,load`
— pagehide before unload, once each, and exactly one `load` on the container
element per navigation — plus the parent arena back at its live-node baseline
after a tick. The other cases cover fragment navigation and `hashchange`,
`location.assign` / `replace` and the history they join, `pushState` /
`replaceState` / `back` / `forward` / `popstate`, and an origin change flipping
the parent's view to the cross-origin branch of the same object.

### What this phase does not do

It does not replace the top-level realm; see B, which records the blocker
precisely rather than approximating around it. It does not implement `pageswap`,
the Navigation API, `beforeunload` cancellation, `window.open`, form submission
or link-click navigation. It does not move the initial `about:blank` load event
from a queued task to the synchronous point HTML puts it at, which is what the
one honest census regression turns on. It does not lift the parsing-time
adoption refusal, and `dom` / `dom/nodes` stay red for the same protected loss
as before.

---

## Phase: Associated-state transfer, 2026-09-12

The adoption boundary refused two whole classes of subtree by name rather than
by fact: anything carrying associated state — a shadow tree, a template's
contents — and *anything at all* while a parser was still working in the source
document. Both refusals were blunter than the specs they stood in for, and the
second one is what `dom/nodes/Node-isConnected.html: Test with iframes` had been
stopped on since the browsing-context lifecycle phase isolated it.

**Branch:** `lane/shadow-template-adoption`.
**Base commit:** `546201874df`

### 1. A shadow tree moves with its host

DOM's adopt steps move a node's **shadow-including** inclusive descendants, so
the storage-side member walk is now shadow-including and template-including: a
host carries its shadow root, that root's nodes and its nested hosts, together
with the slot assignment tables and any pending `slotchange` entries. An edge
that would straddle the boundary is still refused, so nothing arrives dangling,
and a shadow root is never itself the thing adopted — a split host is refused
atomically.

Three runtime-side faults kept that arena-side transfer from reaching script
correctly, and each was a different kind of wrong:

- `__templateOwnerDocument` was a zero-argument sink over the **calling realm's**
  arena, so a reader in the origin realm was told its own inert document rather
  than the destination's. It now takes the fragment and answers for the arena
  that actually holds it.
- The bootstrap dropped a moved template's recorded owner and left the `content`
  getter to re-record it — which no plain `.ownerDocument` read ever reaches. It
  now re-homes the entry outright, after the move, recursively through nested
  templates and through a shadow tree that travelled with its host, and fans
  that out to every same-origin realm through a new `templateOwners` agent op,
  because the move may have run in any of them.
- `assignedNodes()` re-reflected the assignment table's raw ids through the
  realm-local `__reflectNode`, so an adopted slot reported empty. It and
  `slotchange` delivery now route through the agent like every other raw-id
  lookup.

Closed roots stay closed on the far side (`innerHost.shadowRoot` is still
`null`, while the captured `innerRoot` still holds its contents), `ownerDocument`
follows for the root and every node under it, the `adoptedCallback` fan-out
reaches a custom element living *inside* a nested closed root, and every
reflector is the same object before and after — on both engines.

### 2. Template contents are re-homed, recursively

HTML's "adopt the template's contents" re-homes a template's contents fragment
onto the **destination's** inert template-contents owner document, not onto the
destination document and not onto the source's inert owner. The transfer now
mints that document per arena on first use and re-homes nested templates
recursively; the fragment, its nodes and the serialization survive unchanged,
and the destination inert owner is provably neither the source's nor the
destination document itself.

### 3. The parsing guard refuses only what the tree builder holds

The refusal is now the rule HTML actually states. The tree sink tracks the
elements it created and has not popped, plus the form element pointer; the arena
recovers the **stack of open elements** by intersecting that set with the current
node's inclusive ancestors — which drops the never-pushed void elements html5ever
reports no pop for. A completed sibling subtree may therefore leave a document
mid-parse, while `document.body`, still on the stack, is refused, and the
refusal moves nothing.

The during-parse test drives this directly: a `<script>` running at
`readyState === 'loading'` moves a finished sibling `<div>` into an iframe's
document, is refused for `document.body`, and the parse then completes over both.
`dom/nodes/Node-isConnected.html: Test with iframes` is **recovered**, and with
it the file.

Two cycles that the relaxed boundary exposed were closed in the same phase.
DOM's pre-insert step 2 is a *host-including* inclusive ancestor walk; the
bootstrap's walk climbed a shadow root to its host but stopped dead at a
`<template>`'s contents fragment, whose host is its template, so
`tmpl.content.appendChild(anAncestorOfTmpl)` built a tree with no top — which
`template-content-hierarcy.html` hangs on rather than fails. The arena gains the
contents-to-template lookup, `__templateHost` exposes it, and one
`hostIncludingParent` step serves both walks. It is deliberately **not** folded
into `__shadowHost`, which picks the interface and decides the composed root: a
contents fragment is neither a shadow root nor part of its template's composed
tree.

### 4. Container elements arrive as fresh frames; canvas is the residual

`object` and `embed` join `iframe`: HTML destroys a container's nested browsing
context on removal and creates a fresh one on insertion, so all three cross the
boundary as ordinary subtrees and become fresh frames in the destination per the
removing and inserting steps. Appending an `iframe` into the document of its own
child used to panic the frame surface — the removing steps destroy that child's
context, so the element's container document is one whose navigable is gone, and
the creation path indexed the parent context map straight into a missing key.
HTML creates a child navigable only when the container's node document has one,
so a container in that state has no content navigable at all; the same rule makes
a discarded context's `parent` and `top` null rather than the context itself.

**`canvas` is the named residual, and it is refused by fact rather than by
name.** Only a canvas that has minted a drawing context is refused: its registry
index and texture producer answer to the source host alone, and `HostState`
records those at `getContext`. A canvas that has never been drawn into adopts
like any other element. Moving a live WebGL context is a producer-relocation
problem, not an adoption one, and is left to the Ortet/WebGL lane.

`Code/testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-09-12_associated_adoption`.

| Subset | Keys | Pass before | Pass after | Gain | Pass-to-nonpass |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `dom` | 57891 | 46835 | 46837 | +2 | **0** |

Key sets are identical before and after in every subset: no test appeared, none
vanished, and there is nothing to explain on the pass-to-fail side because the
count is zero. The seven gains are exactly the three files this phase set out to
recover and their subtests:

| File | Subtest |
|---|---|
| `dom/nodes/Node-isConnected.html` | `Test with iframes` (and the file) |
| `shadow-dom/untriaged/events/event-retargeting/test-003.html` | `A_05_01_03_T01` (and the file) |
| `html/semantics/scripting-1/the-template-element/template-element/template-content-hierarcy.html` | `Template content should throw when its ancestor is being appended.`; `Template content should throw exception when its ancestor in a different document but connected via host is being append.` (and the file) |

### Repins — both forward-only

Two maps are repinned, both written from the post census above and both verified
key-by-key against the maps they replace.

| Map | Keys | Pass | Demoted `pass` -> non-`pass` | Keys dropped | Promoted to `pass` | Keys added |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `expectations/testharness/dom_boa.json` | 55083 -> 57891 | 44294 -> 46837 | **0** | **0** | 215 | 2808 |
| `expectations/testharness/dom_nodes_boa.json` | 9763 -> 9763 | 6659 -> 6854 | **0** | **0** | 195 | 0 |

**Every former pass is pinned as a pass.** The 2808 added keys in `dom_boa.json`
are subtests the runner now reaches and records rather than new tests: the map
had been pinned before the navigation and lifecycle phases stopped
`Range-mutations-dataChange.html` timing out wholesale. The 410 promotions are
the accumulated arrears of those phases plus this one — the pin had not been
refreshed since before them — which is why the count far exceeds this phase's
own seven.

With the repins in place the **broad `dom` guard is green** for the first time
since it was introduced, at `unexpected=0` over 698 files, and `dom/nodes` with
it.

(`--release --features netfetch`, built from the lane tip). The `dom` guard is
run at the census's own `--timeout 240`; at the driver's default two heavy files
(`Document-characterSet-normalization-2.html`, `Range-mutations-dataChange.html`)
are hang-killed under `--jobs 8`, which is a harness budget, not a result.

### The Ortet receipts, and a correction to what "unchanged" means here

Both receipts are unchanged **by this lane**, proved against a control rather
than against the number on record, because the number on record had already
moved on `main`:

- **`article`** captures `0x86e02f7fcd1c5b04`, three times running. That is not
  the `0x6377ba8a6bf4dbc9` every phase since the Ortet founding plan recorded.
  An Ortet built in a throwaway worktree at the lane's own base commit
  `546201874df` renders the same page to **`0x86e02f7fcd1c5b04`** as well, so the
  move belongs to the Livery compositing commits that landed between the
  WindowProxy phase and this lane's base (`ecaa79296bf` native-resolution canvas
  layers, `62e1a0fad82` authored transform origins), not to adoption. The
  digest was also confirmed path-insensitive: the lane's binary renders the main
  checkout's copy of the page to the same value.
- **`frames`** is **not a stable digest at this base**, and recording one would
  be false. It is bimodal between `0x7ce450775e74208c` and `0x03ad0a534659fdb7`:
  13/5 over eighteen consecutive runs on the lane tip, 12/6 over eighteen on the
  base build. The digest *set* and its rough proportion are the same either
  side, so the lane changes nothing; the instability is inherited and belongs to
  the frame-compositing lane to settle. (Two further one-off digests appeared
  only in a batch run while a full `cargo build` was saturating the machine, and
  did not recur in any unloaded run on either build.)

### What this phase does not do

It does not move a canvas with a live drawing context, which is the one named
residual and a producer-relocation problem. It does not lift the straddling-edge
refusal, which is a correctness boundary rather than a gap. It does not stabilise
`frames.html`'s Ortet digest, and it does not touch the top-level realm, the
`fetch/api/basic` slice, or the initial-`about:blank` load-event timing that the
navigation phase's one honest census regression turns on.


---

## Phase: top-level realm, 2026-09-12

The phase the WindowProxy lane refused to guess at. That lane's B recorded the
blocker precisely — `MAIN_REALM` was the agent's root host *and* the realm the
top-level browsing context's document happened to live in, and `Runtime::eval`,
`Runtime::host` and the interleaved parse all resolved against it by name — so
replacing the top realm was a `Runtime` API lane rather than a navigation one.
This is that lane.

**Base commit:** `546201874df` (`546201874dfa07cf153680a03f46efd93aabcec6`),
the WindowProxy-and-navigation tip.

### The design

`MAIN_REALM` keeps exactly one meaning: **the agent's bootstrap realm**. It
holds the timer queue, the navigation drive and the `WindowProxy` factory, and
it is the one realm the engine refuses to discard. It is no longer where the top
document lives.

The top-level browsing context's document lives in a realm created through the
realm API, with its `WindowProxy` installed as that realm's global `this` from
the realm's first instruction — exactly as a child frame's is. The two are told
apart by one thing only: the top context carries **no `FrameRecord`**, because
it has no container element. That absence is the whole discriminator, and the
regression manifest below records the defect that came of reading it as "this
realm is the top one" rather than "this realm has no container".

**One accessor.** `FrameState` gains `top_realm`, reached through
`FrameState::top_realm()` and re-exported as `Runtime::top_realm()`. Every
top-document question asks that accessor instead of naming `MAIN_REALM`, and
script that runs in the top document goes through `eval_top` rather than
`engine.eval`, which is now only the bootstrap realm's. **41 call sites** moved
in the first commit — the load-completion barrier and `pending_main_load`, the
browsing-context tree's top binding, `top` in both the frame relation and the
cross-origin window-property path, `closed`'s liveness check, `host_in_realm`,
`child_hosts`, the opaque-root policy's four top-realm branches,
`pending_fetches`, the fetch-completion fallback, the worker pump, the whole of
the interleaved parse, the five synthetic event dispatches, `__moPump`, the
testharness load, bridge and two test entries, `fail_all_pending`, and
genet-scripted's compositor walk and Livery's CSSOM binding walk. Because
`top_realm` was still `MAIN_REALM` at that commit, it is a pure API change with
no behavioural delta — which is what made the replacement reviewable.

Nine more entry points had to follow the accessor once the top realm really
moved, none of them findable by the first pass: the three synthetic `load`
dispatches, `DOMContentLoaded`, `readystatechange`, the `matchMedia`
re-evaluation, the two custom-element registry reads the parser makes at every
script pause, and module evaluation. That last one needed a realm-aware entry on
the engine trait, `eval_module_in_realm`, implemented on both backends, because
a module belongs to the document that declared it; on Nova the graph's realm is
pinned for the load, since a dependency is parsed from the host hook while the
root realm is still the running one.

The timer and animation-frame drives keep `engine.eval` **on purpose**: those
queues are agent-wide machinery, which is exactly what the bootstrap realm is
for.

### Navigation through the child route, behind the policy hook

`navigate_top_level` asks the host policy hook — the one thing that still
distinguishes a top-level navigation from a child's — and past that decision
takes the child's route exactly: queue, then unload (`pagehide`, `unload`,
cancellations, teardown), `open_document_realm`, `WindowProxy` rebind,
interleaved parse through `document.open`/`write`/`close`, `load`.

Two things are deliberately not the child's. The drain runs on the **bootstrap
realm**, which is the one realm guaranteed to outlive every document; a child's
runs on its container's realm, for the same reason. And the load goes through a
new `__loadTopDocument` rather than `__loadFrameDocument`, because there is no
`FrameRecord` to rebuild from and the tree is initialized on first navigation
for a document that never had a frame.

One behavioural change worth naming: **`location.assign` no longer moves the URL
synchronously.** HTML's navigate is a task, the top level now really navigates,
and a read in the same script sees the URL the document was loaded with — which
is what a browser does, and what the old edit-the-base-URL approximation could
not be.

### The hosts' unchanged API, and Mere's seam

`Runtime::host()` keeps its signature. A top-level navigation writes the new
document's `HostState` **into the cell the embedder already holds** rather than
allocating a new one, so a borrow taken before a navigation stays valid across a
navigation that replaces everything behind it. This is the seam Mere consumes:
no embedder — genet-scripted, the WPT runner, Ortet, or a Mere-side host —
changes a line for the top realm to move, and the Ortet receipts in the gates
below are the measurement of that claim, not an assertion about it.

### Rooting and teardown parity

Three liveness paths visited `MAIN_REALM` and the child frames and so skipped
the top document once it had a realm of its own: `collect_garbage`,
`rooted_reflector_count`, and the opaque-root policy's cross-realm group
rebuild. The third of those was collecting detached components out from under
script. All three now enumerate **every registered realm**, which is the only
formulation that stays correct when the top realm is just another realm.

`Runtime`'s `Drop` now empties every realm's `HostState`. A realm's host state
is reachable from its `[[HostDefined]]` slot, which lives in the engine heap,
and Boa's heap is a thread-local — so anything left there is dropped from a TLS
destructor, when wgpu's own thread-local is already gone. That aborted the WebGL
conformance test. The defect was latent for child frames all along; it became
load-bearing the moment the top document had a realm.

### The snapshot-clone blocker, and whose it was

The blocker this phase had to clear first was not HTML's. Nova's adapter refused
to snapshot-clone an agent that had ever created a realm, and `snapshot_clone`
is how `NovaHarnessTemplate` gives every WPT test a fresh heap without
re-evaluating `testharness.js`; a top realm at construction would have disabled
it for the life of the process.

The refusal turned out to be **genet's, not vano's**: `GcAgent::snapshot_clone`
copies `realm_roots` wholesale, so a realm keeps its index in the clone, and
only the rooting and the `[[HostDefined]]` slot needed rebuilding. Both are now
rebuilt per realm, and the counter no longer rewinds. Measured cost of the
alternative, had it not been liftable: **37.7 ms per test fresh against 3.4 ms
per clone**, over ~2480 censused files.

### Named regression manifest

Six defects found by a fixture or by the census during this phase, and fixed
rather than recorded. Each is named by what found it.

| Defect | Found by |
|---|---|
| A realm with no `FrameRecord` was taken to *be* the top-level browsing context, so a `Location` held across its own frame's removal navigated the **top** document, fired `hashchange` and moved history | the census, `no-browsing-context.window.html`; receipt `top_level_navigation.rs::a_context_less_location_navigates_nothing` |
| A navigation resolved its input against `None` when the host had set no base URL — the whole WPT disk corpus — so `location.assign('#x')` became a cross-document navigation instead of a fragment one | the census; receipt `a_base_less_top_document_still_resolves_a_fragment` |
| `location.assign("http://:")` resolved to an opaque string, took the top-level route and unloaded the document to go nowhere, taking the harness and the file's already-recorded results with it | the census, the `location_assign` / `location_replace` pair; receipt `an_unparseable_top_level_url_is_abandoned` |
| Nova's adapter refused `snapshot_clone` on any agent that had ever created a realm; the refusal was genet's wholesale `realm_roots` copy, not vano's | `script-engine-nova/tests/realms.rs`, the multi-realm clone receipt |
| `collect_garbage`, `rooted_reflector_count` and the opaque-root policy's cross-realm group rebuild each visited only `MAIN_REALM` and the child frames, so the third was collecting detached components out from under script | `page_weakref_liveness.rs`, `snapshot_realm_boundary.rs` |
| `Runtime`'s `Drop` left a realm's `HostState` in the engine heap, dropped from a TLS destructor after wgpu's own thread-local was already gone; it aborted the WebGL conformance test | the release runtime suite |

The lane's own receipt is
**`components/script-runtime-api/tests/top_level_navigation.rs`** — seven cases
across both backends, fourteen tests:
`the_top_level_navigates_three_times`, `the_policy_hook_can_refuse`,
`a_top_level_fragment_keeps_the_document`,
`top_level_history_joins_and_traverses`,
`a_base_less_top_document_still_resolves_a_fragment`,
`a_context_less_location_navigates_nothing` and
`an_unparseable_top_level_url_is_abandoned`. The three-navigation case asserts,
per pass: a new realm id that was never used before, the outgoing realm
discarded, the new document behind the same `WindowProxy`, and the whole
unload-and-load sequence in one string. The unparseable-URL case runs over the
base-less document the WPT disk corpus actually serves, with an absolute URL as
the positive control. `snapshot_realm_boundary.rs` carries the clone and
teardown parity; `cross_arena_adoption.rs`, `page_weakref_liveness.rs`,
`frame_lifecycle.rs`, `frame_realms.rs`, `navigation.rs`, `realm_clone.rs`,
`realms.rs`, `realm_animation_frames.rs` and `owner_native_boundaries.rs` were
re-pointed at the accessor and stay green.

### Census

Eight subsets, 2491 files, `--engine boa --renderer livery --jobs 8
--timeout 240`, mapped under
`testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-09-12_top_level_realm/`.

| Subset | Files | File gains | File regressions | Subtests before → after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dom` | 698 | 0 | 0 | 46594 → 46594 |
| `html/browsers/browsing-the-web` | 332 | 0 | 0 | 38 → 38 |
| `html/browsers/history` | 140 | 0 | 0 | 96 → 94 |
| `html/browsers/the-window-object` | 96 | 0 | 0 | 86 → 86 |
| `html/browsers/windows` | 60 | 0 | 0 | 8 → 8 |
| `html/semantics/scripting-1` | 515 | 0 | 0 | 1430 → 1430 |
| `html/webappapis` | 356 | 0 | 0 | 1124 → 1124 |
| `workers` | 294 | 0 | 0 | 325 → 325 |
| **Total** | **2491** | **0** | **0** | **−2** |

**No file-level movement anywhere**, and exactly two subtest movements, both in
one file and both **artefacts of the defect this phase fixed**:

`html/browsers/history/the-location-interface/no-browsing-context.window.html`,
"Invoking `assign` / `replace` with `about:blank` on a `Location` object sans
browsing context is a no-op", pass → fail. Each asserts
`loc.href === "about:blank"` after the call, on a `Location` whose iframe has
been removed. genet does not yet report `about:blank` for a discarded context's
`Location` — which is why **all 21 `assign` / `replace` / `reload` subtests in
that file, and all six `href` setter subtests, fail identically in `pre` and
`post`**; that is the positive control. The two that passed in `pre` passed
*because* of the defect: the context-less `Location` resolved to the top realm,
so `assign("about:blank")` navigated the **top document** to `about:blank`, and
the following read of the top document's URL then happened to match. The fix
removes the accidental navigation, and the subtest falls back to the same honest
failure as its nineteen siblings.

Recovering all 27 needs a discarded context's `Location` to report
`about:blank` for every member, which is a `Location` lane, not a realm one. It
is named in "What this phase does not do" rather than taken here.

**No repins.** No checked expectation map covers any directory that moved, and
nothing moved anyway.

### The two maps this branch does not repin

`dom_boa.json` and `dom_nodes_boa.json` were repinned **on `main`** by the
ordinary-adoption lane. This branch carries the base's copies and, per the lane
instruction, does not touch them; the disagreement is reported rather than
resolved, and belongs at the merge.

Against this branch's copies, the post runner reports `dom` **unexpected=61**
and `dom/nodes` **unexpected=35**. The banked **base runner reports exactly the
same two counts against the same two files** — 61 and 35 — so the disagreement
is between the base and the maps `main` now carries, and this lane contributes
nothing to it. The control is recorded rather than inferred.

Not factored: `script-engine-api` is `publish = true`, so a public type alias there is an API decision, not a cleanup |
| Rustfmt, all five touched crates | clean. (`cargo fmt --check` over the whole workspace is red on `support/patches/parley` and `genet-livery`, both untouched here and both red at the base) |

| Ortet `frames` | **bimodal at this base**: `0x2ba5cb3bdf6747fd`, `0x2ba5cb3bdf6747fd`, `0xcb1e19faee628d44` over three runs, from compositing-commit timing |

Both Ortet figures differ from the numbers the adoption lane banked, and neither
difference is this lane's. **An `ortet` built from the base commit, run three
times per page on the same machine against the same files, produces the
identical six digests — including the same 2:1 `frames` split in the same
position.** The receipts are a property of the base, not of the top-level realm,
and no embedder changed a line for the realm to move.

### What this phase does not do

It does not make a discarded browsing context's `Location` report `about:blank`
for every member, which is what the file carrying this phase's only two subtest
movements actually needs, and which would recover 27 subtests in it. It does not
implement `pageswap`, the Navigation API, `beforeunload` cancellation,
`window.open`, form submission or link-click navigation. It does not move the
initial `about:blank` load event to the synchronous point HTML puts it at. It
does not lift the parsing-time adoption refusal, and it does not reconcile
`dom_boa.json` / `dom_nodes_boa.json` against `main`'s repins — that is the
merge's work, with the control above as its evidence.

## Phase: headed G5 acceptance, 2026-09-12

The open item every phase since the adoption continuation has carried forward is
"full headed G5 acceptance": everything the runtime suite proves about realms,
adoption and lifetimes has been proved with no window in the loop. This phase
closes it. A real winit window drives the frame loop, a script inside the page
performs the whole realms sequence, and three things the script cannot see are
read back and correlated with it, per engine: the presented frame's digest, the
accessibility projection the host published, and the live-node census of the top
document's arena.

**Genet commit:** `11b61a0edab`
(`11b61a0edab4cf74a4c4808e2b80e9cc2fd13aa7`).

### The host decision, by fact

Ortet on `main` **has** a scripted route: `--engine boa` and `--engine nova`
select `ScriptedSessionEngine::<BoaEngine|NovaEngine, _>` in
`ports/ortet/src/shell.rs`, behind the `scripted` / `scripted-nova` features, and
a page loaded that way runs its scripts through `genet-scripted`'s
`LiveryScriptedDocument`. So the host is **Ortet**, not a harness around
`LiveryScriptedDocument`, and no new host was built. The receipt reuses the
conventions of `support/ci/run_ortet_g5_arena_receipt.ps1` — same source-identity
record, same completion-heading condition, same completion-pixel readback, same
deliberate-failing control.

Two facts forced departures from the G5 arena receipt's shape, both established
by running rather than by reading:

- **The fixture cannot be served from the filesystem.** `Origin::of_url`
  (`components/shared/browsing-context/lib.rs`) gives every `file:` URL an
  opaque origin, and an opaque origin is same-origin with nothing, itself
  included. A `file:` parent therefore cannot reach `frame.contentDocument` at
  all, and neither can a `srcdoc` child, which inherits the opaque origin. The
  fixture is served over one loopback http origin by
  `support/ci/ortet_g5_realms_receipt_server.mjs`, a static server for that one
  directory that also records every path it served.
- **The scripted session published no accessibility projection.**
  `DocumentSession::accessibility_projection` had a `None` default and only the
  Livery session overrode it, so a *scripted* document was invisible to the
  accessibility half of this acceptance. That is now implemented for
  `ScriptedDocumentSession` (below).

### What was built

| Piece | What it is |
|---|---|
| `ports/ortet/tests/native/realms/` | the fixture: `parent.html` + `parent.js`, `parent2.html` + `parent2.js`, `child-a.html`, `child-b.html`, `child-c.html`, `realms.css`, `child.css` |
| `support/ci/ortet_g5_realms_receipt_server.mjs` | the one loopback http origin the fixture needs to be same-origin with its child |
| `support/ci/run_ortet_g5_realms_receipt.ps1` | the receipt: build, serve, three passes per engine, every assertion, the deliberate-failing control |
| `ortet --a11y-dump <path>` | a receipt seam beside `--artifact`: every accessibility projection the run publishes, appended one block per revision, as flat text a runner greps |
| `ortet: receipt live nodes first=N last=M` | the top document's arena census at the first laid-out frame and the last presented one, through the session's existing `as_any` observation downcast |
| `ScriptedDocumentSession::accessibility_projection` | the scripted lane's neutral projection, off the retained layout of the last rendered frame, with `Click` withheld from any node whose fragment does not intersect the presented viewport |
| `LiveryCssom::with_retained_frame`, `LiveryScriptedDocument::with_retained_frame_and_dom`, `LiveryScriptedDocument::live_node_count` | the read seams those two need, and nothing wider |

Action dispatch and click-target revalidation are deliberately **not**
implemented for the scripted session: they need a live pointer target for a
scripted document, which is the Livery session's `accessible_pointer_target`
seam and not this lane's. The projection is published; acting on it is not.

### The fixture, and what each stage asks

One native click starts it. Each stage runs in its own timer turn, so the host's
frame-cadence GC tick runs between stages; each catches its own throw and writes
it into the page as a distinct, non-matching heading, so a failure is legible in
the receipt rather than silent.

1. The parent reaches into child A and builds associated state on its `#payload`
   subtree: an **open** shadow root holding a nested **closed** one, beside a
   parser-created `template` whose contents already live in child A's inert
   template-contents owner document — which is asserted to be neither document.
2. `#payload` is adopted **into the parent**. Every invariant the
   associated-state phase names is asserted here and holds: `ownerDocument`
   follows for the subtree, the host, the shadow content and the link; the open
   root travels with its host as the same object; the closed root stays closed
   and keeps its contents; the template's contents are re-homed onto the
   *parent's* inert owner, which is neither the source's nor the parent
   document, recursively through the nested template; and every reflector,
   including `document.getElementById('kept')`, is the same object as before.
3. The parent's own `#away` link is adopted **into child A**, the other way.
4. **Child navigation one**: `frame.src = 'child-b.html'`. Child A is discarded,
   and the away link with it.
5. `#payload` is adopted **back into child B** — into a document that did not
   exist when the subtree left.
6. `#kept` alone comes back to the parent, so exactly one link ends up there.
7. **Child navigation two**: `frame.src = 'child-c.html'`. What is left of the
   subtree goes down with child B; the kept link survives in the parent.
8. Every reference is released and several GC ticks are allowed to run, and the
   page settles on the heading the accessibility assertions are read at.
9. **Top-level navigation**: `location.href` moves the top level to
   `parent2.html`, whose markup is node-for-node the first pass's shape and whose
   `h1` carries the completion heading the host is waiting for. Matching it is
   the proof that the top level was replaced.

### The receipts, per engine

Window `1280x1120` **physical**; Ortet's own `display scale=2` line is read back
by the runner, so the asserted geometry is a **640x560 CSS viewport**, recorded
rather than assumed (the 2026-09-10 correction to the O2 bridge-action receipt).

| Gate | Boa | Nova |
|---|---|---|
| Presented-frame digest, three consecutive runs | `0x8df9c9b8815a6e22` three for three | `0x8df9c9b8815a6e22` three for three |
| Completion heading at the captured frame | `Ortet G5 realms sequence complete` | same |
| Completion pixel at (width-8, height-8) | `#2F6B3C` | same |
| Accessibility: kept link in the settled revision | `role=Link`, `actions=[Click, Focus]`, bounds `33,189,574,31`, node id tagged with the **child's** arena (`7696581394467`) under a parent-arena root (`2199023255552`) | same |
| Accessibility: away link in that same revision | absent | absent |
| Accessibility: a post-navigation revision under a new root | revision 10, root `47278999994368`, carrying the completion heading | same |
| Live-node census (top arena) | `first=31 last=31`, all three passes | `first=31 last=31`, all three passes |
| Collection over the run | `unpinned=14 collected=29` | `unpinned=14 collected=29` |
| Deliberate-failing control | an unmet heading under a 25 ms deadline fails the run and reports its bound | same |

The two engines agree on every number, digest included. The digest is **stable**:
the fixture is drawn entirely at 20 px and above with flat fills, deliberately,
so it does not inherit the frames fixture's instability — see below.

### Four defects and residuals this acceptance found

It found them because a window was in the loop; none is visible to the runtime
suite as it stood.

**1. A node could not outlive the realm it was born in — fixed, with a named
regression.** `creation_realm` (`components/script-runtime-api/dom/adoption.rs`)
preferred a node's recorded *birth* realm unconditionally. A node adopted out of
a child browsing context keeps its birth arena tag, so once that child navigated
and its realm was discarded, `reflect_pinned` asked a realm that no longer
existed for a reflector and the whole call died with `Error: NoSuchRealm(2)`.
The recorded creation realm is now used only while it is still a live realm;
otherwise the node's **current owner** answers, which is the owner-resolved rule
the rest of this plan already states. Positive control: with the filter reverted,
the new test fails on both engines with exactly that error; with it, both pass.

**2. `ShadowRoot` and re-reflection identity are not preserved on the return
hop — named residual, not fixed.** Adopting the subtree *back* into a child
yields a *fresh* `ShadowRoot` object rather than the held one, and re-reflecting
a node through the returned root (`root.firstChild`), through the template's
contents fragment, or through `document.getElementById` no longer returns the
object held across the hop — while the held references themselves stay valid and
report the right parent, owner and text. The tree is correct; the wrapper
identity is not. The outbound hop preserves identity exactly, which is what the
associated-state phase's tests assert, so this is a gap in the *return* hop
only. The fixture asserts the tree through identities that are preserved and
states this plainly rather than asserting it away. **Scope for whoever takes
it:** the same-arena round trip is covered by
`cross_arena_associated_transfer.rs::shadow_tree_round_trip`; what is uncovered
is a round trip whose source realm has been discarded in between.

**3. An external script of a document reached by an in-session top-level
navigation is not fetched — named residual.** After `location.href` moved the
top level, the server was asked for `parent2.html`, its stylesheet and its child
frame, but **never** for `parent2.js`. The completion condition therefore lives
in `parent2.html`'s markup and its completion paint in an inline script; the
external script is kept only so the two passes have the same node shape, and
says so in a comment.

**4. `ortet.exe` does not always terminate after its event loop exits — named
residual.** On Boa, all three passes reported their entire receipt and then
lingered; on Nova every pass exited cleanly. A host-owned background runtime
outlives `main`. The runner gives the process the receipt deadline plus twenty
seconds, then stops it, and accepts the run only if the completion line was
already written — it warns loudly rather than hiding it.

### The compositing lane's instability, characterized

The frames fixture's bimodal digest was to be characterized if it reproduced,
and not averaged away. What reproduced at this commit is **broader than
`frames.html`**: the `article` fixture, recorded as three matching captures in
the two previous phases, is **also unstable here** — and the variable is the
**window size**, which points at glyph rasterization rather than frame timing.

| Fixture | Window (physical) | CSS viewport | Runs | Digests |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| `article` | 640x400 | 320x200 | 4 | `0xbebd4a74f765263d` four for four — **stable** |
| `article` | 1280x1200 | 640x600 | 3, `--frames 3` | `0x9dbe44635b0d03cb`, `0x91de7697a0c708a3`, `0x6bac9850b7d13f30` — three distinct |
| `article` | 1280x1200 | 640x600 | 3, settle-driven | `0x9dbe44635b0d03cb`, `0x6bac9850b7d13f30`, `0x6bac9850b7d13f30` — two distinct |
| this lane's realms fixture | 1280x1120 | 640x560 | 3 per engine | one value, both engines — **stable** |

A larger CSS viewport shows more of `article`'s small body text and the digest
destabilises; the same host at the same commit renders this lane's fixture — same
window scale, nothing below 20 px, flat fills — identically six times running.
That is consistent with the earlier sub-10-px glyph-rasterization finding and
against a frame-timing explanation, and it is **the compositing lane's**, not
this one's. Two consequences: the `article` digest recorded by the previous two
phases should be read as *size-qualified*, and a receipt that wants a stable
digest must state its viewport and keep its type large.

### Named regression manifest

| Test | What it pins |
|---|---|
| `script-runtime-api/tests/cross_arena_associated_transfer.rs::{boa,nova}::node_outlives_the_realm_it_was_born_in` | a subtree carrying associated state is adopted out of a child, the child is navigated away, and re-reflecting its nodes through the parent still works — the `NoSuchRealm` defect above, with a verified positive control |
| `ortet/src/args.rs::the_accessibility_dump_is_its_own_opt_in_receipt_seam` | `--a11y-dump` is opt-in, independent of `--artifact`, and needs its value |
| `ortet/src/args.rs::a_receipt_run_carries_its_frames_size_and_artifact` | the dump is absent unless asked for |
| `support/ci/run_ortet_g5_realms_receipt.ps1` | the headed acceptance itself: digest stability over three runs per engine, the completion heading and pixel, the projection assertions on one settled revision, the post-navigation projection under a new root, the live-node census, the collection floor, and a deliberate-failing control |

### Gates

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `script-runtime-api`, both engines, whole suite | **568 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored** (the top-level-realm phase recorded 558; two of the difference are this lane's new tests, and the number is reported as observed) |
| `genet-scripted` with `scripted-nova` | 118 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored |
| `genet-documents` with `scripted-nova` | 49 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored |
| `genet-scripted-dom` | 72 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored |
| `ortet` with `scripted-nova` | 24 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored |
| Clippy, four touched crates, `--all-targets` | **zero errors**; no new warning in a touched line (the pre-existing unused-import warnings in `genet-scripted/livery.rs` and `genet-documents/src/engines/tests.rs` are red at the base and untouched here) |
| Rustfmt, every touched file | clean. Whole-crate `cargo fmt --check` is still red on `script-runtime-api/frames.rs`, untouched here and red at the base |
| Headed realms receipt, both engines | **passed**, three consecutive matching digests each |
| Ortet `article`, three runs | see the table above: **stable at 640x400, unstable at 1280x1200** — reported as observed, and the instability attributed to the compositing lane |

Artifacts: `C:/Users/mark_/Code/testing/genet/ortet-g5-realms-20260912/`
(per engine, per pass: log, PNG, SHA-256, the appended projection dump, the
parsed assertions, the completion-pixel record, `digests.json`, `summary.json`,
plus the source-identity records and the server's request log) and
`C:/Users/mark_/Code/testing/genet/ortet-article-640-20260912/`.

### What this phase does not do

It does not fix the return-hop reflector identity, the unfetched external script
after a top-level navigation, or Ortet's lingering exit; all three are named
above with their scope. It does not give the scripted session accessibility
*action dispatch* or click-target revalidation, only a projection. It does not
run a WPT census — nothing here moves a web-platform behaviour except the
`NoSuchRealm` fix, whose reach is pinned by its own regression on both engines.
It does not stabilise `article.html`'s digest at a large viewport, which is the
compositing lane's to settle.

## Phase: residual closure, 2026-09-13

**Status:** The three targets below are verified from
`6ebd3598f63865dfa3f7f8b3fe4e413e6a92109e`, with the broader inventory still open.
The handoff's scoped acceptance is confirmed in the current tree. The original
sections 2–4 above were still labelled planned after their implementations
landed; their labels now point to the continuation and navigation phases.

### Targets and done-conditions

| Target | Done-condition |
|---|---|
| Classic external scripts after navigation | The stream parser uses the installed resource route, resolves relative URLs, preserves parse order and `currentScript`, and does not run missing resources or data blocks. Both top and child navigation have automated coverage; the headed fixture's completion depends on its external script. |
| Discarded `Location` | Reads report the components of `about:blank` immediately after removal and after queued teardown, writes navigate nothing, and the retained document's URL is unchanged. Both engines and the named WPT file are checked. |
| Retired host resources | Dropping the runtime releases resources held by hosts removed from the live realm registry, before engine heap destruction. A retained old host is a regression control; headed Boa runs must exit normally. |

### Findings

- `dom/markup_insertion.rs::script_source` explicitly skipped external scripts.
  `frames.rs::{LoadTopDocument, LoadFrameDocument}` both load through that stream,
  so the scope includes child documents and explicit post-parse writes.
- `Runtime::drop` visited only `AgentState::hosts`, whereas frame teardown removes
  hosts from that map before the engine heap necessarily releases them. A weak
  inventory of registered host lifetimes now covers teardown without keeping old
  documents alive merely for bookkeeping.
- `platform.rs` used `__locationField('href')` for both `Location.href` and
  `Document.URL`. The [Location definition](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/nav-history-apis.html#the-location-interface)
  gives the context-free Location an `about:blank` URL; it does not rewrite the
  retained Document's URL. The two reads therefore need distinct paths.
- The identity residual includes loss at the first re-reflection after discard,
  not just at the subsequent return adoption: `creation_realm` falls back to the
  physical owner while the canonical reflector and JS wrapper caches were in the
  old realm. Changing that fallback again is insufficient. Any fix must preserve
  the held object and its creation-realm prototype while maintaining connected
  roots, detached component groups, and collection after the last reference.

### Remaining inventory

| Item | Owner and next proof |
|---|---|
| Reflector identity across source-realm discard and another adoption | **Closed in the [wrapper identity phase](#phase-wrapper-identity-after-disposal-2026-09-13).** Both-engine regressions and strengthened headed acceptance preserve ordinary, shadow, closed-root and template identities, with GC between hops and final collection. |
| Canvas with a live drawing context | Canvas/WebGL host producer ownership. Move context storage and the producer together, preserving context identity and pixels, before lifting the refusal. |
| Initial `about:blank` load ordering | Frame insertion/parser integration. Recover the named synchronous load expectation without running unload in removing steps. |
| `execution-timing/112.html` | Parser script scheduling, tracked in the parser/interleaving plan. |
| `Location.ancestorOrigins` | Location/DOMStringList surface. This absent API is the one remaining failure in `no-browsing-context.window.html`, now 45/46. Implement ancestor order, origin values and the required object lifetime before closing it. |
| `document.domain` | Origin/security surface, still outside the landed core checks. |
| `pageswap`, Navigation API, `beforeunload` cancellation, `window.open`, forms and link-click navigation | Separate navigation surfaces. The landed realm replacement machinery does not implement them. |
| Scripted accessibility action dispatch and stale-target validation | Scripted document session. The headed G5 receipt proves projection only. |
| Actual capture replay | Capture owner. The accessor phase supplied imported-identity translation and tests, not a complete replayer. |
| Range and charset-test throughput | WPT measurement. The default 30-second guards time out under load; isolated pre/post controls are recorded below. The large data-change file still exceeds 120 seconds on both runners. |
| Inherited server-mode fetch count | Fetch/WPT server route. The earlier 55 unexpected results used `--features netfetch --spawn-server`; this phase's unchanged disk-mode census does not close that separate receipt. |
| Glyph digest instability | Livery/compositing. Keep CSS viewport and display scale attached to each headed receipt. |

Classic stream script loading does not by itself close external module loading
or the stream's async/defer scheduling. Those consume the parser scheduler's
ordering model and remain separate from the blocking-classic target above.

### Progress and receipts

The unmodified runner was built with the locked graph before code edits and
copied to `testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-09-13_realms-residuals/`, alongside the
lockfile, runner digest and source identities. Boa is `52cfb6ff9efd`, Vano is
`8ad0841255c2`. The focused census covers Location, Window, iframe, parsing,
script-element, DOM-node and fetch-basic directories with four workers and a
120-second worker bound. New regression failures and post-change results are
recorded separately from that census.

Implementation uses the existing classic-script preparation path for stream
parser pauses. `ScriptResourceLoader::load_classic_script` lets byte-backed
hosts reuse the initial parser's decoding and integrity check; text-only loaders
decline integrity metadata they cannot verify. The bootstrap restores the outer
`currentScript` after nested writes and insertions. Discard tracking changes only
the Location URL read, while `Document.URL` keeps its own path. A weak host
inventory covers resources retained after execution registration ends.

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| New runtime regressions, both engines | **8 fail before / 8 pass after**, covering top and child navigation, nested external writes/currentScript, discarded Location, and retained old-host teardown |
| New resource-bridge regressions | 2 pass: valid/invalid integrity, charset decoding, and rejection after close |
| Full crate suites | **841 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored**: runtime 576, genet-scripted 120, genet-documents 49, scripted DOM 72, Ortet 24 |
| Seven-directory WPT census | **1,426 files, +37 named subtest passes, zero lost passing subtests**, with identical file keys |
| Default testharness guards | 12/14 at `unexpected=0`; `dom` and `dom/nodes` retain the timeout qualifications below. **No expectation repins.** |
| Rendering guards | Both at `unexpected=0` |
| Runtime library Clippy | Exit 0; warnings are outside changed lines |
| Formatting and syntax | Changed Rust files pass rustfmt except the existing whole-file formatting differences in `frames.rs`; new frame-state lines follow its surrounding style. JS syntax, PowerShell parsing and diff whitespace checks pass. |
| Strengthened headed G5 | **3 passes per engine**, normal exit code 0 in every pass; both deliberately unmet-heading controls exit 1 |

The Location file moves **8/46 -> 45/46**, entirely from the discarded URL and
no-op navigation behavior. Window, iframe, script-element, DOM-node and
disk-fetch maps are identical. Parsing keeps all 2,606 passes; four blob-URI
variants vary between failed subtests and no results under the 15-second drive
deadline. Isolated reruns match for `html5lib_blocks`, `html5lib_domjs-unsafe`
and `html5lib_webkit01`; `html5lib_tests20` exhibits both states on both runners.
The original maps and those reruns are retained separately, not normalized into
a cleaner census.

The 30-second DOM guard timed out on `Document-characterSet-normalization-2`,
`Range-mutations-dataChange` and `Range-mutations-replaceData`; the narrower
DOM-node guard also timed out on `Document-characterSet-normalization-1`.
The full DOM-node census at a 120-second worker bound reproduces the complete
pre-change map. Isolated controls for charset normalization 2 give identical
0/339 results at 51.24 seconds before and 46.70 after. Range replacement retains
all **1,146/1,146** passes at 29.69 and 31.25 seconds. The large data-change test
exceeds 120 seconds in both controls, so its semantic count remains unverified
in this phase. These are load-qualified observations, not performance acceptance.

The headed fixture now starts the second document with a waiting heading. Only
the fetched `parent2.js`, after observing the inline setup, can publish the
completion heading and paint. Both engines retain digest
**`0x8df9c9b8815a6e22`** at CSS **640x560**, physical **1280x1120**, scale **2**;
live nodes remain **31 -> 31**, with **14 unpinned / 29 collected**. The receipt
runner rejects a lingering process, records exit codes, hashes the binary and
dirty source files, and verifies source identity before and after the run.

Artifacts:

- `C:/Users/mark_/Code/testing/genet/wpt-ledger/2026-09-13_realms-residuals/`:
  saved pre/post runners, lockfile, exact maps, named comparisons, timeout and
  parser controls, full crate log, regression controls and guard results.
- `C:/Users/mark_/Code/testing/genet/ortet-g5-realms-residuals-20260913/`:
  per-pass pixels, projection assertions, live-node/collection counts and
  process exits; both failure controls; source identities and server requests.

Pre runner SHA-256:
`f6722ff0637f5382a8be9e16c95fac0080f6cb5ab86a25c25b05c73022c13247`.
Post runner:
`e6b7e18f477bcf94ac71de2955a41bb8f77cb6a2d586f3d7daa66f9c44631e44`.
The locked graph is unchanged; no fork or renderer dependency was repinned.

## Phase: wrapper identity after disposal, 2026-09-13

**Status:** implemented and verified. Base source is
`b15ced95ff23e925d946cad804d3e1ca187f5a4b`.

### Findings

- The old fallback from a removed creation realm to physical ownership could
  mint a second reflector on the first lookup, on both engines. The first eight
  removal/navigation regressions all fail against unchanged production code.
- `CallCx::relocate_reflectors` now moves selected weak cache entries and their
  existing roots between registered slots. It refuses a destination collision
  before changing the batch; native creation identity and prototypes stay put.
  Runtime teardown performs this move after unload handlers, before removing
  registrations, for pins physically held in surviving stores. A per-node
  custody record handles another disposal after a subsequent adoption and is
  retired with the reflector's death report.
- Canonical wrappers, detached groups and recorded owner documents now use
  agent-shared weak maps. Native reflector objects are the cache keys; equal
  raw IDs in different engine realms remain separate objects. Discarded realms
  leave the registration tables as before, without a permanent strong root.
- The stronger single-descendant test found a separate template gap: native
  contents survived through their host, but their wrappers could die. A directed
  weak-keyed template-to-contents edge now preserves that identity. Contents
  retain no reverse edge to the template, as the negative collection test proves.
- The first headed run completed with the unchanged digest and 31 -> 31 nodes,
  but reported only one unpin (29 collected nodes), below the existing receipt's
  two-unpin requirement. That counter cannot stand in for wrapper identity:
  preserved caches no longer produce the same discarded/reminted entries. The
  fixture now explicitly retains and releases a detached adopted component in
  the surviving parent, so collection is tested independently of document
  destruction. The receipt's collection thresholds remain unchanged.

### Done-conditions and progress

- **Passed:** ten runtime regressions across Boa/Nova: connected/detached trees,
  removal/navigation, repeated adoption and two cache-owner disposals; ordinary
  nodes, nested open/closed roots and template contents; identity, prototypes,
  owner documents, expandos and listeners; one retained descendant; final native
  collection; and directed template retention. Two engine-contract tests also
  pass, covering collision refusal, intact roots, post-disposal lookup and death.
- **Passed:** all 657 tests in 44 engine/runtime test binaries, with zero failed
  or ignored. This includes both GC soak tests and existing cross-realm,
  native-boundary, snapshot and collection tests.
- **Passed:** matched default-feature WPT runners, using the same locked graph
  and unoptimized profile, cover 43 files per engine (86 file/engine cases).
  Every file outcome and named subtest status is unchanged; Boa preserves all
  2,112 passing subtests, including 522 template passes. Nova yields no passing
  subtests in either control; its unchanged no-results/skipped cases earn no
  conformance credit. The runtime and headed regressions are its positive proof.
- **Passed:** three headed runs per engine, each at CSS 640x560, physical
  1280x1120, scale 2. All six retain digest `0x8df9c9b8815a6e22`, report live
  nodes 31 -> 31 and **4 unpinned / 32 collected**, and exit normally with code
  0. Both failure controls exit with code 1. Source identities match before and
  after, and the capture was visually inspected. The fixture asserts identity
  immediately after disposal and on the return hop, and releases an explicitly
  retained detached component before top-level navigation.
- Artifacts: `C:/Users/mark_/Code/testing/genet/realms-identity-20260913/`, with
  the original source archive and lockfile, failing controls, suite logs, exact
  WPT maps and comparisons. Headed results are in
  `C:/Users/mark_/Code/testing/genet/ortet-g5-realms-identity-20260913-final/`;
  the initial accounting failure remains in the sibling directory without
  `-final`. No dependency or WPT expectation was repinned.

ordering, parser scheduling, or the other navigation surfaces in the residual
inventory above.
