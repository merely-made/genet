# Ortet founding plan

## Canvas composition follow-up, 2026-09-11

**Status: native acceptance passed.** Native external canvas content now uses
the normal Vello image stream, retaining the surrounding scene layers and
rendering once at physical output resolution. Authored canvas bitmap dimensions
remain unchanged.

| Standard | Required behavior and done-condition |
|---|---|
| [CSS Color 4 opacity](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#transparency) | Apply opacity once to the completed element and descendants. Overlapping canvas/DOM siblings in a half-opacity parent must match an isolated group oracle. |
| [Compositing and Blending 1 source-over](https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#simplealphacompositing) | Composite premultiplied colors in painter order. Translucent content over and inside a canvas must match analytic RGBA values without a second suffix redraw. |
| [CSS Transforms 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transforms-1/#transform-rendering) | Accumulate ancestor and local transforms through the existing scene transform stack; verify transformed canvas interior pixels. |
| [CSS Overflow 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-overflow-3/#managing-overflow) | Preserve enclosing overflow clips, including clips enclosing transformed canvas content. |
| [HTML canvas](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#the-canvas-element) and [WebGL drawing buffer](https://registry.khronos.org/webgl/specs/latest/1.0/#5.2) | Place the replaced bitmap in its content box. CSS display scaling and DPR must not rewrite width/height attributes or drawing-buffer dimensions. |
| [CSS Values 4 reference pixels](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#absolute-lengths) | Rasterize the page at physical resolution. Offscreen scale 1, 1.5 and 2 probes must retain device-aligned sharp edges; native receipts record actual display scale. |

Implementation phases: first preserve in-order image placement and GPU-only
source import; then verify analytic GPU and native Boa/Nova pixels; finally
record exact source/dependency identities and replay the existing host guards.
Each phase closes only with its corresponding passing receipt. Native scale
coverage is limited to scales actually reported by the host.

**Findings, 2026-09-11:** flat external-texture metadata discarded the active
transform and clip scopes. Livery also used border-box bounds and duplicated
element opacity, while the native host enlarged a logical-resolution composite.
Vello's GPU image import requires straight-alpha RGBA8 with copy-source usage;
the default premultiplied WebGL surface therefore needs a GPU conversion stage.
This work does not claim complete WebGL, CSS filters, or blend-mode conformance.

**Origin finding, 2026-09-11:** the first native interior probes passed despite
an incorrect canvas offset. Visual review and independent coordinate arithmetic
showed that Livery ignored authored `transform-origin` and always used the box
center. The nested fixture now tests both sides of the expected leading edge,
its top edge, and trailing clips. The required fix carries authored origins
through Livery and resolves them against the reference border box, following
[CSS Transforms 1 section 5](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transforms-1/#transform-origin-property).
The earlier 15-probe capture at `ecaa79296bf` is preliminary evidence and does
not close the transform gate. CSSOM shorthand/geometry getters are outside this
pixel gate; authored dimensions and drawing-buffer identity remain JS checks.

**Acceptance, 2026-09-11:** clean Genet `62e1a0fad82` with Netrender
`3961aca919` passed all 25 analytic native probes on both Boa and Nova at the
reported display scale 2. The captures match (`0xa440137ccc503f9c`) and have
identical before/after source identities. Artifacts, resolved dependencies and
lock/config copies: `Code/testing/genet/ortet-compositing-standards-20260911-final/`.
The stricter leading-edge probe rejects the old center-pivot renderer; its
negative receipt is at `Code/testing/genet/ortet-compositing-origin-negative/`.

Netrender's committed GPU gate separately checks exact source-over colors and
adjacent clip-edge pixels at scales 1, 1.5 and 2, first source registration,
same-size refresh, resize and removal. The two image-key and two translator
tests also pass (`Code/testing/genet/ortet-compositing-netrender/final-tests.log`).
The existing native WebGL ordering/resize gate and G5 guard both pass on the
same Genet source, including their impossible-heading controls. G5 retains
digest `0xc5d147e70d4e4425` and `unpinned=5 collected=6` on both engines; Boa
presents five frames and Nova six. Guard artifacts are in
`Code/testing/genet/ortet-compositing-webgl-guard-20260911/` and
`Code/testing/genet/ortet-compositing-g5-guard-20260911/`.

Final source validation also passed all 23 Ortet library tests (including four
actual GPU adapter/lifecycle cases), 74 Livery paint tests and 44 value tests.
Default Ortet passes `cargo check` and retains its script-free dependency graph.
Log: `Code/testing/genet/ortet-compositing-final-tests.log`.

This accepts the tested 2D affine, rectangular overflow, opacity and source-over
route. Other reference boxes/SVG, 3D, filters, broad WebGL conformance, and the
runtime's currently hardcoded `devicePixelRatio` getter remain separate work.
Native scale 1 and fractional scale were not exercised by a physical window.

**Rerun at changed sources, 2026-09-16:** the same three runners pass at clean
Genet `f1f21c61d26` with netrender `06f3a12f4` and Vano `8ad084125` (Boa and
Piccolo unchanged). Before/after source identities are identical in each run.

- All 25 probes pass on Boa and Nova at display scale 2. Both captures are
  byte-identical to the acceptance above (`0xa440137ccc503f9c`).
- The WebGL gate keeps `0xb07e372b0126bea5`.
- G5 keeps `0xc5d147e70d4e4425` with `unpinned=5 collected=6`, and every
  impossible-heading control fails as required.
- Boa presented six G5 frames this time. Five repeats of one binary gave
  5, 5, 5, 6 and 5, so the frame count varies with timer wakeups and is not an
  invariant of this guard.
- The netrender GPU gate and key/translator tests pass with the counts above.
- The 23 Ortet library tests pass within today's 36 (`--features scripted-nova
  --lib`); `paint` passes 74 and `values` 44.

Receipt: `Code/testing/genet/t3_acceptance_20260916/results.md`, which also
carries the scene viewport plan's T3 WPT attribution.

**Native WebGL wiring, 2026-09-11:** Boa/Nova now create document-local WebGL
contexts on Ortet's render device before authored scripts run. The native
capture/presentation path resolves live textures in scene order; resize keeps
context keys while replacing storage, and context drop retires registry entries.
Clean Genet `8dffe09375d` with Netrender `18f569c21` passed both engines'
exact red/green/blue ordering pixels at display scale 2 and the timeout controls.
Artifacts: `Code/testing/genet/ortet-webgl-20260911-final/`, including unchanged
before/after source identities. The default script-free route is preserved.
That earlier checkpoint accepted the bounded WebGL surface and plain opaque
composition. The composition follow-up above closes its tested producer
clipping/opacity and physical-resolution rendering gaps.

The existing native G5 guard also passed at those revisions, with unchanged
capture digest `0xc5d147e70d4e4425` and `unpinned=5 collected=6` on both engines
(Boa five frames, Nova six). Its positive and timeout artifacts and unchanged
source identities are at `Code/testing/genet/ortet-webgl-g5-20260911/`.

**Final combined replay, 2026-09-11:** after marker and WebGL host integration,
the same native Boa/Nova gate passed at clean source `6b8b3cc2fca`.
`Code/testing/genet/reconcile-g5-final-20260911/` preserves both positive
receipts, timeout controls, dependency graph, and identical before/after source
identities. Both engines again presented six frames with `unpinned=5 collected=6`
and the completion pixel. The capture/semantic and wider-scope limits below apply.

**G5 reconciliation, 2026-09-11:** the collection counter seam and native
arena fixture/runner have been recovered from the September 9 branch. Native
acceptance passed at clean source `ba7a4df56c6`. The recovered runner requires clean
source repositories, records resolved local dependency revisions and lock/config
hashes, and rejects source changes during the run. The historical branch receipt
used an uncommitted Genet tree and dirty Boa fork and is not current acceptance.

Fresh native Windows receipts at `Code/testing/genet/reconcile-g5-20260911/`
show both Boa and Nova completing the semantic sequence in six presented frames,
with `unpinned=5 collected=6`, the green completion pixel, and the expected
25 ms impossible-heading failure. Source identities match before and after the
run. The 640x400 physical capture at 2x scale clips part of the heading; semantic
completion is recorded in the log, and the completion color is visible.

**Status:** O0 through O5 are landed for the native host. O5's exact-source
Boa/Nova receipts at `f3dc1bcf909` accept native input, timer/microtask
completion, bounded failure, idle-woken fetch and Worker delivery, correlated
semantic/pixel output, and stale-session rejection. Browser http(s) resource
provisioning landed structurally in `35efc1985bc` and its headed HTTP runtime
gate is accepted in `247a52e612a`. AccessKit session-generation custody is
landed, and the Windows native bridge-action gate is accepted by the O2
UIAutomation receipt at source `28fee141665`. **2026-09-10:** the O2
rejection gate is additionally closed natively at current source `f949210ca32`
using `Action::Focus` (accept, stale-reject, unadvertised-reject all
exercised through the real UIAutomation bridge); the 2026-09-05 receipt's
`Action::Click`/Invoke leg was first reported as not reproducing, then
shown on 2026-09-10 to be a harness artefact (a 640x400 physical window on a
2.0-scale display puts the links below the fold, where Click is correctly
stripped), so that acceptance stands and no code residual remains -- see the
correction in `design_docs/receipts/2026-09-09_o2_bridge_action/receipt.md`. Browser-hosted
scripting remains open: the wasm host still constructs only
`LiverySessionEngine`.
Crates.io publication is a later packaging precondition: this workspace
inherits `publish = false`. The `fleece` carve-out is reconciled with the
boundary plan's §9.1 (see Findings); the witness still names fleece on every
run.

Ortet is the raw genet host: the one headed port that proves the engine runs
without Mere. The platform boundary plan
(`mere/design_docs/mere_docs/implementation_strategy/2026-09-02_platform_boundary_and_repository_topology_plan.md`,
§2 and §9.3 ruling 4) leaves Genet "WPT, conformance harnesses, and one small
host that proves Genet works without Mere". Pelt cannot be that host: its
desktop port enables the reader and netfetch lanes by default, and `pelt-core`
depends on `workbench` and `inker`, both Mere authority. Under the "consumers
first" order Mark ruled on 2026-09-03, Pelt moves to mere before Cambium does,
and from that commit genet's only host is `genet-wpt`, which is headless. Ortet
takes the role a smaller host was always going to take.

The name is the botanical one. A genet is a whole clonal colony; an ortet is the
original individual it descends from; a ramet is any member. The raw host is
the reference individual of the engine. Mark ruled "ortet is fine" on
2026-09-03. A crates.io claim awaits a packaging release that explicitly opts
the crate out of the workspace's `publish = false` policy; it is not evidence
of, or a prerequisite for, the host's runtime behavior.

## What ortet is, and is not

- A `ports/ortet` binary over engine crates only. The landed route uses
  `genet-winit-host` (window,
  wheel translation, AccessKit bridge) and through it `genet-render-host`
  (wgpu + netrender boot, rasterize, acquire, compose), `genet-documents` with
  its `livery` feature (`LiverySessionEngine`), `document-session-api`
  (`SessionEngine`, `DocumentSession`, `SessionSpawnRequest`), `netrender`
  (`Scene`), `genet-host-api` (`ResourceFetcher`, `ResourceResponse`) and
  `netfetcher` with its default transport for http(s).
- It drives the session itself. Pelt routes through inker's `SessionRegistry`
  and `PeltController`; ortet holds one `LiverySessionEngine`, spawns one
  `DocumentSession<Scene>` for the address it was given, and maps winit events
  onto the session's semantic input directly. Following a link is spawning a
  new session for the new address.
- Its wasm target drives the same Livery session and target-neutral
  `genet-render-host::RenderCore` through an `HtmlCanvasElement` and DOM input.
  Target selection excludes winit, `genet-winit-host`, and AccessKit from the
  wasm dependency cone.
- It hosts one top-level document in one window. Browser chrome, workspace
  orchestration, reader/product composition and user profiles belong to Mere.
  Engine selection and bounded test configuration belong in Ortet. An explicit
  test storage provider/directory may support future restart receipts without
  making Ortet a product profile manager. Nested documents belong to the
  engine's iframe model when that lane lands.
- **Its dependency cone contains no Mere crate**, and the cone witness says
  so on every CI run: none of `inker`, `workbench`, `cambium*`, `mere-*`,
  `nematic`, `errand`, `document-canvas`, `pelt*`, `tabard`,
  `knot-editor-host`. `fleece` is not Mere: the boundary plan's §9.1
  reclassed it independent, an engine-side lower library, and this list
  first said otherwise from memory; the witness names it separately so the
  carve-out is visible and cannot widen.
- Its receipts are self-driven. `ortet --url <file or http(s)> --frames N
  --artifact out.png` presents N frames, reads the last one back through
  `genet-render-host`, writes the PNG, prints the frame digest and exits
  non-zero on a blank frame. That is what CI and a plan can cite; a person
  looking at the window is confirmation, not the gate.
- The web receipt is `support/ci/run_ortet_chromium_receipt.ps1`. It builds the
  wasm library, packages it with `wasm-bindgen`, drives headed Chromium through
  DevTools, serializes the WebGPU canvas to PNG, decodes the PNG through a
  separate 2D canvas, and rejects missing page, box, border, or glyph tones.

## Phases

### Platform testing roles (Mark's ruling, 2026-09-07)

| Vehicle | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `genet-wpt` | Primary automated conformance runner: WPT discovery, variants, assertions, scoring, exact maps and regression manifests. |
| Ortet | Genet's headed reference host: prove real session execution, input, scheduling, resource delivery, presentation and teardown without Mere. |
| Pelt in Mere | Browser-port composition and downstream integration of Mere with Genet. Its receipts supplement Genet's own proofs. |

Ortet's script-free founding route is an implementation stage, not a permanent
restriction. Add scripting through the shared engine/session seam under O5.
A missing Genet headed proof should drive that integration rather than make
Pelt a prerequisite. Ortet does not duplicate WPT discovery or scoring; a
fixture or WPT-driven hosted check records the actual execution route, and
only the conformance runner awards WPT credit.

O0-O4 prove the raw `LiverySessionEngine` route. They do not establish page
JavaScript execution or a persistent storage provider. The
[deferred web-platform scoping](2026-09-07_deferred_web_platform_lanes_scoping.md#shared-acceptance-and-host-prerequisites)
uses scripted Ortet as the target for Genet's JS-driven headed receipts.
Native O5 receipts now qualify that host route; browser-hosted scripting keeps
its own later gate. Restart/storage tests additionally need an explicit
provider.

### O0. Found the crate

- `ports/ortet/Cargo.toml` (workspace-inherited version, license, edition;
  `publish` as the workspace sets it; a description that says what it is),
  `ports/ortet/src/main.rs`, `ports/ortet/README.md`, workspace member entry
  beside `ports/pelt`; every new source carries the house header (copyright
  line, Exhibit A, SPDX).
- `support/ci/check_dependency_cones.py` gains `assert_ortet_cone`: resolve
  ortet's cone from `cargo metadata` and fail on any crate in the forbidden
  set above. The current positive control runs the same `resolved_cone`
  traversal over a synthetic Cargo-shaped graph: intermediate packages reach
  both an exact forbidden name and a forbidden prefix, two same-named package
  IDs have distinct outgoing paths, non-normal edges stay excluded, and an
  allowed graph stays clean. `assert_ports_depend_inward` asserts Ortet's
  manifest and prevents any component from depending on a port.

**Done when:** `cargo check -p ortet` is green, the witness passes with the
positive control, and `python support/ci/check_dependency_cones.py` is what
CI already runs.

### O1. The desktop viewer

- Boot `SurfaceHost` on a winit window sized from `--size` (default 960x640);
  `NetrenderOptions::for_untrusted_content()`, since a raw browsing host is
  exactly the case that option exists for.
- Fetcher: `LocalFetcher` for `file:` and bare paths, falling back to a
  netfetcher-backed `ResourceFetcher` for http(s) over the default transport,
  on a background tokio runtime the host owns. Nothing else: no trust store,
  no scheme sniffing, no smolweb.
- Per frame: `session.frame(w, h)` gives the `Scene`; rasterize, acquire,
  compose, present, as the host crates document. `pump` and `settled` drive
  redraw scheduling.
- Input: pointer down/move/up, wheel via the host's translation into
  `scroll_at`, keyboard through `key_input` and `scroll_for_key`, text and IME
  input, focus in and out, resize. A `SessionClick` whose effect navigates
  spawns a new session for the new address; the window title follows.
- The receipt path above, with the PNG written through the `png` crate the
  workspace already carries and the digest from `RgbaFrame::digest`.
- A fixture under `ports/ortet/examples/`: one script-free article with a
  linked stylesheet, an image and an in-page link, so one receipt exercises
  fetch, layout, paint and navigation. Reuse Pelt's `p5-resources` fixture
  only if it needs no Pelt code.

**Done when:** the article receipt produces a non-blank frame with a digest
that is identical across two runs on the same machine; a headed run opens
the fixture, scrolls, and follows its in-page link and one external link to a
second document; `cargo test -p ortet` (unit tests for the argument parser and
the fetcher's scheme split) is green; and the O0 witness still passes.

### O2. Accessibility

- Wire `AccessKitBridge` the way Pelt's workspace viewer does, over the
  session's accessibility projection from `document-session-api`, with the
  host correlating raw `A11yActionRequest` values to its published projection
  mapping before routing them back into the session. The bridge request itself
  carries only its target, action, and action data.
- Treat a session replacement as an accessibility identity boundary. The host
  assigns a monotonically increasing session generation and namespaces every
  document-local node ID by that generation before it enters the bridge.
  Reused local IDs in a new document therefore cannot name nodes from the old
  tree.
- When the host publishes a tree, it records each bridge-visible target's
  session generation, document-local target, projection revision, and
  advertised actions. A drained request must match that published mapping; a
  request queued under document A must never be correlated with document B's
  current observation. The host rejects an absent or generation-mismatched
  mapping; the session then revalidates the current revision, target, and
  advertised action. Pointer actions use the same current click-target
  revalidation before they enter ordinary input routing.

**Done when:** the bridge reports the session-provided document root with an
article-heading descendant named `Ortet`; a queued action from document A is
rejected after navigation to document B even when B reuses A's local node ID;
an action whose revision or
advertised action changed is rejected; and one current focus or scroll action
is accepted by a live session and visibly changes its projection or scroll
state.

### O3. The web target

The boundary plan's P0-P5 landed 2026-09-02 through 2026-09-04, so they are no
longer a deferral condition. The prior canvas host,
`cambium-genet-web-host`, now belongs to Mere; its wasm receipt proves that
Mere adapter, not an Ortet web host. Genet does retain the needed lower seam:
`genet-render-host::RenderCore::create_surface` documents
`wgpu::SurfaceTarget::Canvas(HtmlCanvasElement)`, and its manifest has neither
winit nor AccessKit. The missing feature cone is Ortet-owned: this workspace
has `ports/ortet` only, its manifest directly selects `genet-winit-host` and
`winit`, and it contains neither a browser entrypoint nor a wasm-specific
manifest. O3 starts by adding that narrow target without importing the former
Cambium host.

Ortet's web target is the same `RenderCore` over an `HtmlCanvasElement`, driven
by DOM events, with no Cambium. Its receipt must include a real Chromium
non-blank canvas readback; a screenshot alone is insufficient.

**Done when:** `wasm32-unknown-unknown` builds, the article renders in Chromium
with a non-blank canvas readback, and the witness holds for the web target's
cone too.

**Landed 2026-09-06:** `ports/ortet/src/web.rs` owns the canvas surface and DOM
input adapter. The target-filtered witness reuses the Ortet forbidden set and
also rejects AccessKit, winit, and `genet-winit-host`. The checked-in Chromium
receipt proves the article field, a content box and border, and bundled Ahem
glyph paint from decoded canvas pixels. Browser http(s) fetching remains a
separate adapter problem because the current engine `ResourceFetcher` is
synchronous; O3's reproducible fixture uses a data document and data font.

### O4. Take over Pelt's place

When Pelt moves to mere (boundary plan P3): ortet becomes the workspace
`default-members` entry, the witness drops the Pelt manifest assertion and
keeps ortet's, and the boundary plan's ruling 4 records the smaller host as
the answer.

**Done when:** genet's root `cargo build` builds ortet, no dependency or
manifest assertion points at Pelt, and the boundary plan and naming ledger both
say so. The retained forbidden `pelt` prefix is intentional.

The workspace package policy is `publish = false`, inherited by Ortet. A later
packaging lane must decide whether Ortet is publishable, opt it into a release,
clear the package graph for a registry dry-run, and claim its name only by a
real publication. That work does not change O4's host, session, presentation,
or dependency-cone done-condition.

The witness's former live positive control was the one thing Pelt's departure took with it.
`pelt-desktop`'s cone exercised both halves of `is_ortet_forbidden` at once — an
exact name (`inker`) and a prefix (`cambium`, `mere-`) — and no single remaining
member reaches both. Neither `cambium` nor `cambium-genet-winit-host` reaches
`inker` at all, checked before choosing. Those two controls were retired with
their crates on 2026-09-03. The current gate uses a synthetic Cargo resolve
graph that exercises the actual traversal through intermediate packages to an
exact forbidden name and a forbidden prefix, including two versions of a
same-named package with distinct outgoing paths. It also proves dev and build
edges are excluded and retains an allowed graph control. Predicate assertions
remain a separate guard on the name list; they are not presented as a live
graph control.

### O5. Scripted platform host (native route accepted 2026-09-08)

Extend the existing host with selectable script-free, Boa and Nova execution
modes, using the same window, session input, rendering and capture path.
`ScriptedSessionEngine<E, Fetch>` already implements `SessionEngine<Scene>`;
the existing boxed `DocumentSession<Scene>` is the host-facing contract.
Keep renderer choice distinct from script-engine choice: these modes all
consume Livery/Buckram. Exact CLI/feature spellings are an implementation
choice; unsupported combinations must produce a clear diagnostic rather than
silently choosing another engine.

**O5a: engine selection — landed 2026-09-07.** Ortet replaced its concrete
engine selection with the common session contract while preserving the
script-free route. It instantiates supported scripted modes through
`genet-documents` without importing Pelt, Inker or Cambium, and records the
actual engine, target, features and source revision for receipt callers.

The structural selection slice landed at `07b4e7a40b4`: native Ortet accepts
`--engine livery|boa|nova`, holds the selected engine behind
`SessionEngine<Scene>`, and reuses it for navigation. The default build keeps
both script engines out of its dependency cone; `scripted` adds Boa and
`scripted-nova` adds Nova on supported 64-bit native targets. Successful runs
report the stable engine id, concrete backend, target, enabled features and an
optional `GENET_SOURCE_REVISION`. A receipt without that revision remains
unqualified. O5a closes selection and dependency-cone ownership. O5c's native
per-engine headed receipts are accepted below.

**O5b: production session integration — landed 2026-09-08.** Resource and
scheduling adapters must serve the real document session, not a harness-only
copy of the runtime.

`5a5a5cd2049` lands the host-provided resource bridge, session generations,
completion-driven winit wake scheduling, bounded semantic completion, and
asynchronous Worker resource handoff. Page fetch completion is staged before
external work can report idle. A failed replacement re-wakes the restored live
generation, while a successful replacement rejects the former generation's
late completion. `8d6439de4ac` reserves the Windows UI stack required by the
debug Boa/Nova host without moving winit off its platform thread.

- Provision document/external-script loads and script fetch/worker resource
  requests through the existing host contracts with consistent base URL,
  response metadata and policy. General engine fixes live in `genet-scripted`,
  `script-runtime-api` or their session adapters, not in Ortet-specific JS.
- Drive timers, microtasks, asynchronous fetch and worker completions through
  the session's `pump`/pending-work contract. Specify how a worker or network
  completion wakes an otherwise idle host; it must not require user input or
  continuous repaint. Preserve task ordering and host-clock behavior.
- Propagate script-driven DOM/layout changes into the next presented frame.
  Replacing or closing a document cancels or retires its outstanding work and
  rejects late results belonging to the previous session. Keep worker
  termination and thread cleanup at the shared runtime boundary.
- Use bounded receipt completion and timeout/error reporting. A frame count
  or nonblank image alone cannot prove that an asynchronous script finished.
  Expose a verifiable completion condition and DOM/semantic readback through
  an engine-owned inspection seam, then correlate it with the captured frame.

**O5c: acceptance — accepted for native Boa and Nova 2026-09-08.** Freeze the
named fixtures and regression manifest before implementation. Native
acceptance exercises both Boa and Nova where supported:

1. A loaded page executes inline and external JS, changes DOM after a
   timer/microtask and handles native input; semantic readback and pixels
   confirm the resulting state.
2. A live-server fetch changes the page after the host has become idle.
   The response wakes the host and presents without a synthetic input event.
3. Once the Worker runtime slice is ready, a page exchanges messages with a
   live worker, displays its result and passes the same idle-wakeup check.
   This proves hosted integration; the Worker lane still owns clone, transfer
   and actual buffer-detachment conformance requirements.
4. Navigation/replacement and close with pending fetch/worker work prove
   cancellation, cleanup and exclusion of stale DOM/frame updates. Script
   errors and an unmet completion condition produce failing receipts.
5. Existing static/native accessibility and wasm O0-O4 regression receipts
   hold. Dependency-cone checks cover each new supported feature/engine
   combination and retain the prohibition on Mere crates.

**Arena continuation (agreed 2026-09-07).** Scripted Ortet also hosts the
[G5 arena semantic-contract proof](../docs/2026-06-11_gc_arena_dom_plan.md#g5-arena-semantic-contract-agreed-planned-2026-09-07):
retain a node, detach it, collect, adopt it, mutate it, render it, then release
it. G5 owns the identity/mutation/lifetime assertions and collection metrics;
Ortet owns production session execution, semantic readback and correlated
frame capture. The single-arena native G5 sequence is accepted by the clean
September 11 replay at `ba7a4df56c6`, described above. Browser-hosted and broader
G5 gates remain separate. O5 does not inherit all future shadow/iframe arena
work as prerequisites.

The first scripted acceptance is native. Preserve the existing script-free
wasm route and measure its cone/build; browser-hosted Boa/Nova scripting and
worker placement need their own target receipts before being advertised.
Canvas 2D, service workers, IndexedDB and editing use this host as their engine
lanes become ready; O5 does not claim those APIs or add persistent storage.

**Done when:** O5a stays selected through the common host contract, and O5b
drives timers, microtasks, external completions and document replacement through
one production session lifecycle. O5c then has frozen, exact-source, per-engine
hosted receipts: semantic completion and a correlated final frame after native
input, an idle-woken live-server completion, Worker delivery when that runtime
is available, and replacement/close cancellation with stale updates excluded.
Each receipt must fail for an unmet condition or timeout. Runtime-only tests,
a runner that has not passed its acceptance cases, and WPT-only results remain
partial evidence.

The native done condition is met at exact source `f3dc1bcf909`. The runner
passed the static input/timer/microtask fixture, a deliberate 25ms unmet-heading
failure, delayed live fetch, delayed Worker resource/message delivery, and
replacement with a rejected late fetch for both Boa and Nova. Each positive
case records the engine id, backend, final address, exact semantic heading,
PNG, SHA-256 and completion-color pixel; live cases also retain ordered server
events. The receipt directory is
`Code/testing/genet/ortet-o5-20260908-r5/`. Browser-hosted scripting and G5 arena
acceptance keep their own later gates. The Windows AccessKit bridge-action gate
is already accepted by O2's UIAutomation receipt below.

## Findings

- 2026-09-07: `ports/ortet/src/{shell,web}.rs` select `LiverySessionEngine`;
  `genet-documents/src/engines/scripted.rs` already supplies
  `ScriptedSessionEngine<E, Fetch>` and forwards session `pump`/`settled` to
  `LiveryScriptedDocument`. At review commit `61b40915dea`, the document's
  pump drives timers/microtasks and its pending-work check inspects timers
  (`genet-scripted/document.rs`). Worker pump/resource changes are concurrent
  WIP in the runtime/harness, not a production-session receipt. O5b later
  resolved that seam through the shared runtime and session contracts.

- 2026-09-03: `genet-winit-host` and `genet-render-host` already split the
  window-specific from the target-neutral present mechanics, and both
  document the per-frame shape a host follows; ortet adds no rendering code.
- 2026-09-03: `LiverySessionEngine<Fetch>` needs only a `ResourceFetcher`;
  `genet-documents` no longer depends on inker, netfetcher, errand, nematic or
  document-canvas after the boundary plan's P1, so the engine half is the
  whole of what ortet needs from the documents crate.
- 2026-09-03: Pelt's `static_viewer.rs` (2,622 lines) is the nearest prior
  art, but 140 references to the engine and host crates are wrapped in inker
  routing, Pelt profiles and seven product receipts. Ortet is written fresh
  against the two host crates and the session traits, not extracted from it.

- 2026-09-03 (**needs a ruling**): the forbidden set above names `fleece`, but
  ortet cannot avoid it and no amount of care in ortet will change that.
  `genet-documents` reaches `fleece::extract_main_text` unconditionally at
  `components/genet-documents/src/engines/clip.rs:114`, so anything holding a
  `LiverySessionEngine` holds fleece. This is not an oversight in the manifest:
  §9.1 of the boundary plan already **reclassed fleece as independent** — "it
  may stay in genet as a lower library or leave for its own repository, but it
  does not go to Mere" — with `genet-scripted` and `genet-documents` as its
  engine-side consumers and a CI-witnessed cone of `layout_dom_api` +
  `unicode-segmentation`. The two documents disagree, and this plan's list is
  the later one. Resolved for now by naming fleece separately in
  `assert_ortet_cone` (`ORTET_RECLASSED`), which prints it on every run and
  fails if the carve-out ever widens, rather than dropping it from the list
  silently. Three ways to settle it: strike fleece from this plan's list and
  cite §9.1; move the clip lane behind a `genet-documents` feature ortet does
  not enable; or reclass fleece back and split it out of `genet-documents`.
  The first is the smallest and matches the boundary plan; it is Mark's call.
  **Resolved 2026-09-03, the first way:** §9.1 was ruled with the rest of the
  inventory and is the authority; this plan's list was written from memory and
  is corrected above. The witness keeps naming fleece on every run.

- 2026-09-03: nothing else in the forbidden set is reachable. `assert_ortet_cone`
  walks 592 packages from ortet over normal (non-dev, non-build) resolve edges
  and finds none of `inker`, `workbench`, `cambium*`, `mere-*`, `nematic`,
  `errand`, `document-canvas`, `pelt*`, `tabard`, `knot-editor-host`. The
  positive control over `pelt-desktop`'s cone reports eleven of them, `inker`
  included, so a clean result is not a broken walk.

- 2026-09-03: **an in-page `#fragment` link never reaches the host.**
  `genet-livery` scrolls to the element itself and returns
  `ClickOutcome::Scrolled` (`components/genet-livery/src/document/selection.rs:253`),
  which the session adapter turns into `SessionClick::Handled`. Only a
  cross-document href becomes `SessionClick::Navigate`. O1's plan text ("a
  `SessionClick` whose effect navigates spawns a new session") is therefore
  right about the mechanism but describes only half the fixture's link
  behaviour; both halves are receipted below.

- 2026-09-03: an address the user typed as a filesystem path has to be
  normalized to an absolute `file://` URL before it reaches the engine.
  `genet_host_api::navigation::resolve_href` joins a `#fragment` onto the
  *document* only for a base with a scheme; against a bare path it joins onto
  the directory (`docs/a.html` + `#x` -> `docs/#x`). `args::address_from_argument`
  does the normalization, and its scheme test has a two-character floor so a
  Windows drive letter (`C:\pages\a.html`) stays a path rather than a `c:` URL.

- 2026-09-03: `NetrenderOptions::for_untrusted_content()` sets only
  `apply_limit_buckets`; it leaves `tile_cache_size` and `enable_vello` at their
  defaults, and `render_vello` needs both. The host must spread it:
  `NetrenderOptions { tile_cache_size: Some(64), enable_vello: true,
  ..NetrenderOptions::for_untrusted_content() }`.

- 2026-09-03 (observation, not ortet's to fix): in the scrolled receipt the
  fixture's `float: right` figure overlaps the body text it should displace,
  and its `figcaption` paints over the following paragraph. The float lands in
  the right place at the top of the document, so this is a Buckram float/line-box
  interaction, not a host bug. Recorded here because ortet is now a cheap way to
  see such things; chasing it belongs to the layout lane.

- 2026-09-03 (observation, not ortet's to fix; layout lane): **the fixture's
  `header` lays out wider than its containing block.** In the article and
  notes receipts at 480x320 logical the standfirst paragraph inside `header`
  wraps at roughly 470 logical px and its lines are clipped at the frame
  edge, and the header's 3px bottom border runs to the frame edge too, while
  the `body`'s own paragraphs wrap correctly at the 400px content box (body
  padding 40px each side). A control run with the paragraph `max-width`
  removed from the stylesheet produced the identical digest
  (`0x6377ba8a6bf4dbc9`), so the fixture's `max-width` is not the cause. The
  shell's sizing was checked and is right: the session is framed at the
  logical size and the scene rasterized with the device scale
  (`shell.rs` `render`). One thing to check first in the engine: whether the
  UA sheet blockifies `header` (and `nav`, `figure`, `figcaption`), since an
  inline `header` would explain both the wide lines and the border.

- 2026-09-05 (source-only follow-up): `components/genet-livery/src/lib.rs`
  `CAMBIUM_UA_DEFAULTS` already blockifies `header` and `nav` (around line
  120), so that part of the hypothesis is excluded. The UA defaults omit
  `figure` and `figcaption`; floated `figure` blockification and the effective
  `figcaption` display still need runtime probes. The header-width observation
  remains unresolved, and this source check does not establish the earlier
  overlap observation's root cause.

- 2026-09-05: the cone witness used package names as traversal identities.
  Cargo permits multiple package IDs with one name, and either version can have
  different dependencies, so the old walk could omit a forbidden outgoing path.
  It now visits package IDs and reports names only after traversal. Its
  synthetic Cargo-shaped resolve graph has two `relay` versions that separately
  reach `inker` and `mere-test` through intermediate packages; it also proves
  dev/build poison is excluded and an allowed `genet-livery` graph stays clean.
  This replaces the retired `document-canvas` and
  `cambium-genet-winit-host` live controls. The live Ortet witness still proves
  its actual normal-edge cone reaches `genet-documents` and `netrender`.

- 2026-09-05: P0-P5 of the platform-boundary plan are landed, so O3 is not
  waiting on that migration. `genet-render-host` already owns the target-neutral
  canvas seam, but Ortet has only the native `genet-winit-host` feature cone.
  The work still missing is a small Ortet browser entrypoint and wasm manifest,
  plus the Chromium readback receipt; the old Cambium web-host receipt belongs
  to Mere and cannot close this gate.

- 2026-09-05: O2's reusable seams already exist in
  `components/genet-documents/src/engines/livery.rs`: the session publishes a
  revisioned `DocumentA11yProjection`, returns revision-bound click targets,
  and rejects stale or unadvertised actions in
  `dispatch_accessibility_action`. The concrete next O2 slice is host-owned:
  add `AccessKitBridge` to `ports/ortet/src/shell.rs`, namespace projection
  node IDs by an Ortet session generation, install/update the bridge from the
  current projection, and drain requests back through the session's revision
  and action checks. `genet-winit-host/src/a11y.rs` supplies the platform
  adapter, but does not supply Ortet's session-generation custody.

- 2026-09-05: a document root and its heading are distinct semantic nodes.
  Ortet preserves the session-provided document-root name and exposes `Ortet`
  as the fixture heading descendant; it does not fabricate a document name from
  the first H1 merely to satisfy the earlier loose O2 wording. Native probes
  therefore target the `Ortet` heading and the `Field notes` hyperlink rather
  than asserting an invented root label.

- 2026-09-05: `AccessKitBridge` queues only a host node ID, action, and data;
  it does not preserve an engine projection revision. Ortet therefore gives
  every published projection fresh host node IDs and retains each ID's
  generation, local target, revision, and advertised actions. An asynchronous
  request from an older publication then has no current binding and is rejected
  instead of being re-stamped with a newer observation. This favors action
  custody over stable platform IDs across revisions, so assistive technology
  may observe node identity churn after a semantic update. Keeping stable IDs
  would require a bridge-level publication token or an atomic queue/publication
  contract; neither belongs in Ortet's host-local O2 slice.

- 2026-09-05: a replacement session can temporarily have no accessibility
  projection. Ortet now publishes a single content-free Document tree in that
  state and clears the old action map, rather than leaving the former document
  visible to the platform while merely rejecting its actions. It publishes that
  withdrawal once per absence, avoiding empty-tree churn on later frames.

- 2026-09-05: Ortet now lowers the projection's selected, expanded,
  checked/toggled, live, orientation, popup, and numeric range state, retaining
  absent option values rather than converting them to false. `multiline` maps
  to AccessKit's multiline text role. AccessKit 0.24 has no independent
  editable-state property; Ortet retains the text role and explicit read-only
  bit but does not invent a value for `editable`. That missing direct mapping
  is a contract limitation to revisit with the bridge/API, not a claim that
  whole-projection state is faithful.

- 2026-09-05: **O2 accepted on Windows.** The final native probe opened
  `C:/Users/mark_/Code/targets/genet-font-proof-20260905/debug/ortet.exe`
  built from `28fee14166580c19df464fa26845e2b998d9d75e` (SHA-256
  `71E3CC1F4750191128D785F6035265A80C2A1EE05905DC2881E92812D2494B1D`).
  Windows UIAutomation found the Document, the named `Ortet` heading, and the
  `Field notes` hyperlink; `SetFocus` made that link the OS focused element.
  After a fresh tree acquisition across Ortet's intentionally rotated
  publication IDs, Invoke navigated to `notes.html`, whose `Field notes`
  heading replaced the old `Ortet` heading. The reproducible probe is
  `C:/Users/mark_/Code/scratch/genet-k6-ortet-20260905/probe-uia.ps1`; receipts
  are `uia-final.log` and `ortet-uia-final-launch.log` in the same directory.
  O3 remains the separate raw-web-host and Chromium-readback gate.

- 2026-09-05: O3 has a reusable target-neutral seam in
  `components/genet-render-host/src/lib.rs::RenderCore::create_surface`,
  including `wgpu::SurfaceTarget::Canvas`, while `ports/ortet` still has only
  the native `winit` entrypoint and no wasm target module or manifest. The next
  O3 slice is a target-gated Ortet web entrypoint that boots
  `RenderCore::boot_async`, creates the canvas surface, drives the existing
  session/frame path, and adds a Chromium non-blank readback receipt. The
  native `SurfaceHost` and AccessKit adapter must stay out of that wasm path.

- 2026-09-05: the registry branch of the global boundary witness had gone
  stale after the 2026-09-03 moves. The Mere workspace inventory and Genet's
  movement comments identify the moved families as Pelt (`pelt`, `pelt-core`,
  `pelt-desktop`), Tabard, the Cambium family (`cambium*`, `meristem`,
  `sprigging`), Workbench, `mere-surface-api`, and the engine-management names
  already listed in the witness. The registry predicate now names the
  unprefixed members and uses only the moved `cambium` and `pelt` prefixes.
  `document-session-api`, `fleece`, and `netrender` retain their documented
  engine or independent classifications; the synthetic negative control keeps
  them accepted. `inker` is among the newly forbidden moved names.

- 2026-09-05: loading the pre-change classifier from `e78eaa86a4d` and feeding it
  explicit registry fixtures for `inker`, `cambium`, `workbench`, `nematic`,
  `sprigging`, `meristem`, and `pelt-desktop` returned an empty result. The
  updated classifier catches all seven; this is a separate regression receipt,
  rather than a self-test that reimplements the old rule.

## Progress

- 2026-09-08: **O5 native scripted hosting accepted** at exact source
  `f3dc1bcf909`. Boa and Nova each passed static native input followed by
  timer/microtask completion, a deliberate bounded timeout failure, an
  idle-woken live fetch, an idle-woken Worker resource/message result, and a
  navigation replacement that logged and excluded the prior generation's
  late fetch. Semantic headings and final-frame color pixels agree across both
  backends; PNGs, SHA-256 files, logs and ordered server events are retained at
  `Code/testing/genet/ortet-o5-20260908-r5/`. Focused runtime/session/Ortet
  suites, native all-feature and default/wasm checks, and both Ortet dependency
  cones passed. The aggregate dependency-cone script remains red on its
  independent stale Fleece dependency allowlist.

- 2026-09-07: **O5a structural engine selection landed** at `07b4e7a40b4`.
  The real Ortet shell now selects feature-gated Livery, Boa or Nova engines
  through the shared `SessionEngine<Scene>` contract, keeps the script-free
  default cone, reports backend/build provenance, and reuses the selected
  engine across navigation. Native default, Boa and Nova unit cones passed 19
  tests each; the default wasm32 check passed. Direct cone inspection found no
  script engine in default Ortet, Boa only under `scripted`, Boa plus Nova under
  `scripted-nova`, and no forbidden Mere/product crate in any of the three.
  Headed per-engine mutation receipts, deadline wake, asynchronous fetch,
  cancellation and Worker integration remain O5b-O5c work.

- 2026-09-07: Recorded Mark's platform-testing role ruling and planned O5
  scripted Ortet modes through the shared session seam. Genet retains its
  own headed proof path; Pelt provides downstream composition evidence.
  Documentation only: O5 implementation and acceptance remain open.

- 2026-09-03: plan written; O0 and O1 dispatched.

- 2026-09-03: **O0 landed.** `ports/ortet` founded: `Cargo.toml` (workspace
  version/license/edition/publish, its own description), `README.md`,
  `src/lib.rs`, `src/args.rs`, `src/fetch.rs`, `src/main.rs`; workspace member
  entry beside `ports/pelt`; every source carries the house header (the
  relicense audit's "without Exhibit A" stayed at 6, all in other lanes, while
  owned sources went 881 -> 885). `support/ci/check_dependency_cones.py` gained
  `assert_ortet_cone`, wired into `main()` on the resolve-graph metadata the
  Mere-source witness already fetches, so the script runs `cargo metadata`
  no more often than before.

  Receipt — `python support/ci/check_dependency_cones.py`:

  ```
  ortet cone: 592 packages, none forbidden; positive control over pelt-desktop
  reports ['cambium', 'cambium-genet-winit-host', 'cambium-rootstock',
  'cambium-winit', 'cambium-winit-a11y', 'document-canvas', 'inker',
  'mere-document-lanes', 'mere-surface-api', 'pelt-core', 'workbench']
  ortet cone note: ['fleece'] present - reclassed independent by the boundary
  plan 9.1, reached through genet-documents' clip lane
  dependency-cone witnesses passed
  ```

  Done-conditions: `cargo check -p ortet` green; the witness passes with its
  positive control; the script is the one CI already runs. All met, with the
  `fleece` carve-out recorded in Findings.

- 2026-09-03: **O1 landed.** `src/shell.rs` (the winit window, the per-frame
  shape, pointer / wheel / keyboard / text / IME / focus / resize routing, and
  navigation as re-spawning the session) and `src/receipt.rs` (compose into an
  owned texture, read back, write the PNG through `png`, digest through
  `RgbaFrame::digest`, non-zero exit on a blank frame). Fixture under
  `ports/ortet/examples/`: `article.html` (script-free, a linked `article.css`,
  a generated 48x48 `mark.png`, an in-page `#propagation` link and a
  cross-document link) plus `notes.html`. The swatch is written byte by byte,
  not borrowed.

  A headed run driven by a person is not something CI or an agent can produce,
  so the plan's headed done-condition is met instead by `--actions`, a
  deliberately two-verb driving list (`scroll:<dx>,<dy>`, `click:<x>,<y>`)
  applied once after the first laid-out frame. It is documented in the README
  and is not to grow into a scripting language.

  Receipts, all at 960x640 on a 2x display (so a 480x320 logical viewport):

  | run | actions | frame digest | settled at |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | article, run 1 | none | `0x6377ba8a6bf4dbc9` | `article.html` |
  | article, run 2 | none | `0x6377ba8a6bf4dbc9` | `article.html` |
  | scrolled | `scroll:0,240` | `0x43a2675a3e2a6712` | `article.html` |
  | in-page link | `click:100,185` | `0x48442e53798e22f3` | `article.html` |
  | cross-document link | `click:210,185` | `0xb4499d1e2aea318b` | `notes.html` |

  The two unactioned runs agree to the digest *and* byte-for-byte in the PNG
  (sha256 `da19d04a3cbd5403e12435a8f677ce31…`), so the receipt is reproducible on
  one machine. Both driven runs move the digest, and the frames show it: the
  scrolled frame opens on "What the word carries", the fragment frame on the
  "Propagation" heading, the cross-document frame on "Field notes". The address
  moves only for the cross-document run, which is the Findings entry above made
  visible. Nothing is blank; a blank frame would have exited non-zero.

  Done-conditions: identical digest across two runs on one machine, yes;
  non-blank, yes; the headed scroll + in-page link + second document, met
  through `--actions` receipts rather than a person's hands; `cargo test -p
  ortet` green (10 unit tests over the argument parser and the fetcher's scheme
  split, including a positive control that the local lane really reads a file,
  so its "unsupported scheme" misses are not an instrument that answers `None`
  to everything); `cargo check -p ortet` green with no new warnings;
  `cargo clippy -p ortet` reports nothing in ortet's own sources (the workspace
  lints it does report are pre-existing elsewhere). The O0 witness still passes.

- 2026-09-03: **O4 landed, except the publish claim.** Pelt left genet the same
  day (`ports/pelt`, `ports/tabard`, `components/inker/knot-editor-host` and
  `components/mere-document-lanes`, 129 tracked files), so ortet takes the
  places Pelt held:

  - `default-members = ["ports/ortet"]` in the root manifest, and the six
    workspace entries the four crates held (three members plus
    `knot-editor-host`, `mere-document-lanes`, `pelt-core` and `pelt-desktop`
    in `[workspace.dependencies]`) are gone with them.
  - `assert_ports_depend_inward` asserts ortet's single manifest at
    `ports/ortet/Cargo.toml` where it asserted Pelt's two. The rest of that
    function — no `components/` crate may name a `ports/` path, and
    `genet-host-api` has exactly one manifest — is unchanged.
  - The cone witness's positive control split in two, for the reason recorded
    under O4 above. Checked before choosing: `cargo tree -p cambium` and
    `cargo tree -p cambium-genet-winit-host` both reach `inker` zero times, so
    neither candidate the move suggested could carry the `inker` half alone.

  Receipt — `python support/ci/check_dependency_cones.py`:

  ```
  ortet cone: 592 packages, none forbidden; positive controls: document-canvas
  reports ['inker']; cambium-genet-winit-host reports ['cambium',
  'cambium-rootstock', 'cambium-winit', 'cambium-winit-a11y',
  'mere-surface-api', 'workbench']
  ortet cone note: ['fleece'] present - reclassed independent by the boundary
  plan 9.1, reached through genet-documents' clip lane
  dependency-cone witnesses passed
  ```

  The cone is still 592 packages, unchanged by Pelt's departure, which is the
  point: ortet never reached any of it.

  Other receipts: root `cargo build` (default member, so this is the ortet
  binary) finished green; `cargo check --workspace` green with 0 errors and 24
  warnings across eight crates, every one pre-existing and none in ortet;
  `cargo check -p ortet` green; `cargo test -p ortet` 10 passed;
  `cargo check -p netfetcher --no-default-features` green. The relicense audit
  went 887 -> 843 owned sources, exactly the 44 sources in the four removed
  directories, with "without Exhibit A" unmoved at 6 (all in other lanes).

  Packaging remains separate: the workspace's inherited `publish = false`
  policy means a registry release needs an explicit package decision and
  package-graph preparation. That is not pending Ortet runtime work and does
  not alter this O4 closure.

- 2026-09-05: **O0/O4 witness hardening landed.**
  `support/ci/check_dependency_cones.py` now traverses Cargo resolve package
  IDs, never package names, and runs a synthetic positive/negative control
  before it reads the workspace graph. The positive graph reaches both `inker`
  and `mere-test` through separate versions of `relay`; dev-only
  `pelt-dev-only` and build-only `cambium-build-only` stay outside the cone.
  The allowed graph reaches only `safe-middle` and `genet-livery`. This is the
  current graph-control receipt after the historical Pelt,
  `document-canvas`, and `cambium-genet-winit-host` controls departed with the
  boundary migration. O2's done-condition now names generation-scoped IDs,
  host correlation of raw bridge requests to their published mapping, queued
  A-to-B rejection, revision/action revalidation, and one live accepted action.
  O3 now records the landed boundary, retained `RenderCore` canvas seam, and
  missing Ortet-owned web feature cone.

  Receipt from the detached sparse worktree after adding `tests/unit` (the
  workspace's `tests/unit/*` member glob): `python -m py_compile
  support/ci/check_dependency_cones.py` passed, then `python
  support/ci/check_dependency_cones.py` passed with:

  ```text
  resolved-cone synthetic controls: exact and prefix forbidden paths found;
  same-name package ids both traversed; dev/build edges excluded; allowed graph clean
  ortet cone: 600 packages, none forbidden; historical live positive control: none
  (retired with P3); predicate control: forbids all 26 exact names, forbids
  cambium-/mere-/pelt-anything, admits genet-livery
  dependency-cone witnesses passed
  ```

  The final check at source `dccb680f94f` produced the output above. The
  600-package result is the refreshed sparse-review metadata witness,
  compared with the prior 597-package artifact; the three newly visible
  allowed names are `chacha20`, `jni-sys-macros`, and `objc2-core-video`.
  This verifies the witness from the sparse review checkout, which lacks the
  primary checkout's local `.cargo/config` overrides. It is a graph receipt,
  not a frozen-WPT or headed-host receipt.

- 2026-09-05: registry-route controls now exercise explicit synthetic
  packages for `inker`, `cambium`, `workbench`, `nematic`, `sprigging`,
  `meristem`, and `pelt-desktop`; the old predicate misses all seven, while
  the updated witness catches them. The negative control keeps `fleece`,
  `document-session-api`, and `netrender` clean. The isolated review artifacts
  are `Code/scratch/genet-plan-review-20260905/metadata.json` and
  `Code/scratch/genet-plan-review-20260905/cone-regression.json`; the ignored
  generated `Cargo.lock` SHA-256 is
  `95C994BF5F2D12348F0B19394692537B087B1F6200DB6BFA8DB14232B012D538`.
  No unlocked primary resolution was run; locked primary resolution was
  blocked by the local override graph and failed read-only.

- 2026-09-05: final integration at `caa562d1e3a` passed the synthetic and
  live dependency witness again: 600 packages, none forbidden, 26 exact moved
  names guarded. The font diagnostic adds dev-dependency edges, so the generated
  lock changed to SHA-256
  `C2F5FD457EE09BE046BAA75F84530A646D761ECD33E2578F65F56F794E800E9C`;
  this matches the font lane's retained `Cargo.font.lock`. The earlier lock
  remains archived as `Cargo.cone.lock` beside it. Normal Ortet reachability
  and the seven registry regression results are unchanged.

- 2026-09-05: read-only O2/O3 source review identified the host-side
  accessibility custody and target-gated canvas entrypoint as the next slices;
  no implementation or runtime receipt was claimed.

- 2026-09-05: **O2 implementation is ready for native acceptance.** Ortet now
  builds its AccessKit tree from `DocumentA11yProjection`, installs the native
  bridge while the window is hidden, makes the window visible only afterward,
  updates the tree after session changes, and drains platform actions on the
  event loop's redraw wake. `ports/ortet/src/a11y.rs` owns the generation and
  publication binding; `shell.rs` owns native bridge lifecycle and routes
  accepted click actions through the ordinary pointer/navigation path. No new
  `--actions` verb or accessibility CLI was added.

  Automated receipt: with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=Code/targets/genet-font-proof-20260905`,
  `RUSTFLAGS=-C debuginfo=0`, `cargo test -p ortet --offline -j 1` passed all
  15 tests. Four new O2 tests use a real Livery `DocumentSession`: they
  retain a document root plus named `Ortet` heading, reject a queued A request
  after a B publication that deliberately reuses A's local ID, withdraw a
  missing projection's old tree and actions, and reject an old same-session
  publication and an unadvertised action while accepting a current Focus action
  for the `Field notes` link. The remaining O2 gate is a native platform
  receipt:
  inspect the published tree, invoke focus on `Field notes`, and observe the
  resulting focused projection through the installed bridge.

  One additional lowering test builds a semantic checkbox/range projection and
  proves checked, selected false, live, numeric min/value/max, orientation and
  popup state arrive in AccessKit while missing state stays absent.

- 2026-09-05: **O2 landed on Windows.** The final UIAutomation receipt used
  source `28fee14166580c19df464fa26845e2b998d9d75e` and executable SHA-256
  `71E3CC1F4750191128D785F6035265A80C2A1EE05905DC2881E92812D2494B1D`.
  It found the Document, `Ortet` heading, and `Field notes` hyperlink; focused
  the link; re-acquired the rotated publication tree; invoked the link; and
  observed `notes.html`'s `Field notes` heading replace `Ortet`. This accepts
  O2's Windows gate. The host's fresh-ID publication policy remains deliberate:
  it rejects asynchronously queued stale actions at the cost of platform node
  identity churn after semantic updates. O3 remains open.

- 2026-09-06: **O3 landed.** Integrated commit `0903067b4df` adds the
  wasm-only Ortet canvas host, DOM pointer/wheel/keyboard/focus/resize routing,
  browser pointer capture, target-gated native dependencies, and a checked-in
  Chromium DevTools receipt. `genet-render` now separates neutral document
  projection from optional AccessKit lowering, retaining AccessKit in its
  default native feature set while `genet-documents` consumes the Livery-only
  path.

  The first pixel receipt painted the page field and heading border but exposed
  missing glyphs. The cause was shared resource classification:
  `data:font/ttf` had no filename extension and entered the image ledger.
  `genet-document-resources` now recognizes font data MIME types, and its
  focused resource-ledger test passes. The final receipt loads the checked-in
  Ahem TTF through the ordinary `@font-face` data URL and retained
  `TextSystem`, without an Ortet-private text path.

  `cargo check -p ortet --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --locked --offline`
  passed, as did both default and Livery-only `genet-render` feature checks,
  the 15 native Ortet tests, the focused data-font test, script syntax checks,
  and `git diff --check`. The durable dependency witness reports 600 packages
  in the native Ortet cone and 283 in the target-filtered wasm cone, with no
  Mere/Cambium names and no AccessKit, winit, or `genet-winit-host` in wasm.

  The final 640 by 400 decoded canvas contains 156,808 page-tone pixels,
  29,400 content-card pixels, 6,084 border pixels, and 32,328 glyph-tone
  pixels. RGBA FNV-32 is `0x04cf0045`; PNG SHA-256 is
  `50cda9fd2c7c613c4fe192f140900a71ff4f4b6658b705e44b7a806a62fc6542`.
  The checked-in runner repeated those exact counts and hash from combined
  final source `96f2f65c5bf`; local artifacts are under
  `C:/Users/mark_/Code/scratch/genet-k6b-ortet-o3-20260906/chrome-final-main/`.

  Browser http(s) loading now uses the staged path recorded below. Authored text
  on wasm still supplies font bytes through `@font-face`; no system fonts exist
  there.

- 2026-09-06: **Browser resource provisioning landed structurally.** Integrated
  commit `35efc1985bc` gives the wasm host browser-owned http(s) fetch for both
  the top-level document and the session's staged linked stylesheet, nested
  import, image, and font requests. The top-level response retains its
  redirect-final URL as document identity and resource base, including the
  requested fragment where applicable.

  `StagedResourceResolution` owns the exact DOM and immutable response ledger
  that Livery will spawn. Requests are rediscovered through the existing
  resolver and only the currently pending canonical request may be supplied;
  the prepared Livery session therefore cannot diverge from a separate static
  DOM or an arbitrary response map. Redirect-final URL and content-type
  metadata remain with each resolved resource, including redirected fonts.

  Browser reads stream response bodies under configurable per-response,
  aggregate-byte, and resource-count budgets. Navigation generations gate both
  success and failure publication, so an older load cannot replace or log over
  a newer one. The focused resolver and prepared-session receipts, including a
  redirected-font metadata case, passed with the wasm Ortet check.

  2026-09-06: **The headed HTTP runtime gate is accepted.** Integrated main
  commit `247a52e612a` (review source `8de3f373ec1`) adds
  `support/ci/run_ortet_chromium_http_receipt.ps1`. Its checked-in invocation,
  `./support/ci/run_ortet_chromium_http_receipt.ps1 -ArtifactDir <artifact-dir>`,
  builds the wasm host, serves the local HTTP fixture, drives Chromium DevTools,
  and retains `chromium-receipt.log`, `chromium-canvas.png`,
  `chromium-canvas.sha256`, and `http-receipt-requests.json`.

  The accepted 640 by 400 receipt counted 69,240 page-tone pixels, 133,848 card
  pixels, 8,920 border pixels, 24,462 glyph-tone pixels, and 3,744 image-tone
  pixels. Redirect, HTML, CSS, nested import, image, font, denied-resource, and
  budget-rejected checks were all true. RGBA FNV-32 is `0xf6d99fe5`; PNG
  SHA-256 is `fb29e1e44b7e1548414355a40ab88916ccf5a0e1713d4a803b91c29affe3a316`.
  The retained request ledger covers `/start`'s redirect, final HTML, base CSS,
  two imports, the image, authored Ahem TTF, the 403 resource, and a budget
  overflow request.

  This accepts the browser resource-runtime boundary for the script-free wasm
  host. It does not accept browser-hosted scripting: `ports/ortet/src/web.rs`
  still constructs `LiverySessionEngine`, with no Boa or Nova selection.
  AccessKit session-generation custody is implemented, and its Windows native
  bridge-action gate was accepted by the O2 UIAutomation receipt at
  `28fee141665`. Publication remains a later packaging decision.

- 2026-09-10 (later): **The Invoke residual below is withdrawn.** An isolated
  bisect by the web-platform lanes session found the symptom identical at
  the earlier source and the suspected commits byte-identical on that path:
  `ortet --size` is physical pixels, the display scale is 2.0, so the 640x400
  receipt window is a 320x200 CSS viewport and `article.html`'s links sit
  below the fold, where `accessible_pointer_target` returns None and the
  projection strips Click by design. At 640x1200 both sources expose
  `InvokePattern` for the two visible links. Harness fix, not code fix: pin
  the scale or state a CSS viewport, and assert the link's bounds are inside
  the window before querying. Correction recorded in the O2 receipt.

- 2026-09-10: **O2's rejection gate is closed natively; the 2026-09-05 Invoke
  leg is an open residual, not invalidated.** At current source `f949210ca32`
  (`f949210ca324695bde59c80728933429a146492b`), a real Windows UIAutomation
  client (`support/ci/run_ortet_o2_bridge_action_focus_receipt.ps1`) exercised
  `a11y.rs`'s fresh-ID publication policy with `Action::Focus` instead of
  Click/Invoke: `AutomationElement.SetFocus()` forwards `Action::Focus`
  unconditionally through `accesskit_windows`, reaching the same `route()`
  the O2 gate is about. Three cases against `article.html`, all under
  `C:/Users/mark_/Code/testing/genet/ortet-o2-bridge-action-20260909/`:
  a current `SetFocus()` on `Field notes` dispatches and the focused
  projection reads back as `Field notes` through
  `AutomationElement.FocusedElement` (`focus-accept/`); the same
  client-cached `Field notes` element reused for a second `SetFocus()` after
  its own republish is refused (`focus-stale-reject/`); and `SetFocus()` on
  the non-interactive `Ortet` heading is refused (`focus-unadvertised-reject/`).
  Both rejections land at the OS/UIAutomation layer itself -- an empty-message
  HRESULT failure for the retired host id, and UI Automation's own
  `IsKeyboardFocusable` gate for the unadvertised case -- before Ortet's
  `drain_accessibility_actions` rejection log line fires; `route()`'s own
  generation-mismatch and unadvertised-action branches remain verified by
  `a11y.rs`'s four in-process unit tests, not by this native evidence.

  Reproducing the 2026-09-05 receipt's `InvokePattern.Invoke()` positive path
  at this source finds `AutomationElement.GetSupportedPatterns()` empty and
  `InvokePattern` unavailable for every hyperlink in `article.html`, so it
  does not reproduce; this does not invalidate the 2026-09-05 acceptance,
  which recorded what it observed on `28fee14166580c19df464fa26845e2b998d9d75e`
  at that time. Candidate range: 11 commits touched the pointer-target path
  since that source, notably `9a994bb4193` (Shadow DOM/Livery flat tree),
  `f2fb66aa1c9` (Livery hit-testing), and `cfb7cbc2e55` (nested browsing
  contexts). The defining function is `accessible_pointer_target` in
  `components/genet-documents/src/engines/livery.rs` (currently line 650) and
  its Livery counterpart. Per ruling, this slice does not widen into
  `components/genet-livery` or `components/genet-documents` to bisect it;
  that is left to the layout lane. Full detail, reproduction commands, and
  environment are in
  `design_docs/receipts/2026-09-09_o2_bridge_action/receipt.md`, including an
  open question: this receipt's own scripted synthetic-pointer-click attempt
  at the link's screen coordinates did not navigate to `notes.html`, which
  qualifies rather than confirms an earlier claim that the pointer pipeline
  is independently healthy.

  `cargo test -p ortet --offline` passed at this source (tested tree
  `f949210ca32`; no scripted engine is exercised by this slice). No Rust
  source changed beyond a rejection-path log line in
  `ports/ortet/src/shell.rs`'s `drain_accessibility_actions`.
